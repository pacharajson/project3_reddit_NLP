I'm just completely over bringing my phone with me to the gym or out on the road. Especially since upgrading to a 6. I feel like the apple watch is almost there... can you clear up some questions I have?


What needs I need IN the watch:


Heart rate monitor:
 check


Internal Storage:
 128-256MB would be fine. Enough to keep a couple of playlists on. Lets say 2-3hours of music.


Bluetooth:
  For pairing to headphones and other health / activity equipment (stride sensors, bike speedometers, scales, etc)


GPS:
 To keep track of where I run / bike, compass, and some maps


M8(ish) motion processor:
 Elevation, altitude, measuring form (gyro), an accelerometer, pedometer, etc...


Wifi:
 Not only for syncing but to also support your favorite music app when you're working out indoors around wifi.


Water PROOF:
 Needs to be able to at least handle pools or open water to ""reasonable"" depths - 20-30m


Resilient design:
 It needs to be able to survive some pretty intense conditions. Not full on ruggedized but it needs to be able tot take a little bit of a beating.


Power Profiles:
 Being able to quickly manage ""basic watch"", ""gps enabled"", ""gym mode"", etc.


Battery Life:
 Between 13 (full out heavy use) and up to 160ish hours (basic watch).


From what you know so far does the AppleWatch meet these needs?",2014-12-09

beautiful
. Clearly Apple was proud of it too because it was the very first face ever shown to the public in the Reveal video. 


Now though,
 they completely changed the look of the Earth, removing most of the beautifully detailed cloud cover and changing the shading to make the ocean look like badly-done CGI from the 90's. I don't think there were performance issues as the face was running perfectly fine in Kevin Lynch's demo as well as the hands-on at the September event and even that picture of Mark Newson wearing it in public. So is there any other reasoning behind making it so much uglier? 


Just look at the two pictures and tell me if you didn't know better, you wouldn't think the current face came from earlier in development than the original.",2015-03-10

2,Any thoughts/ideas about a buyback or exchange program?,"One shocker from today is that Tim Cook totally neglected to mention any sort of buy back program or exchange for the Apple Watch. While some people think this means there's simply no such program, I believe they might not have wanted to mention it at this point, as the Apple Watch hasn't even come out yet, and it would be ridiculous to already mention the concept of a gen two. Surely there's got to be some sort of program, at least for the Edition watches, as even Apple knows dumping 17k on a watch that becomes obsolete in two years is stupid. 


Here's my theory: Apple will offer some sort of buyback/exchange/chip swap for the Apple Watch (regular) and Edition, but not the Sport. To me, the Edition and regular feel more premium, and it seems to me that you're paying for the fashion as well as functionality. If you just want the watch, no frills, you obviously go for the Sport, as the other two lines have the same functionality, but if you care about fashion, status, etc. you buy a regular or Edition. Also, the Sport is (kinda) reasonable to replace every two years, at $350, where as the higher end regular, and especially the Edition watches, are simply way too expensive.


The problem for me right now is I'm torn between the 42mm Space Grey Sport, or the 42mm regular with sport band. Both look cool, but I'm obviously partial to the regular's stainless steel over the Sport's aluminum. So right now I'm debating whether to go for the regular, with the better looks and a chance of an exchange down the road, or if I take the safe bet and go for the Sport. Any advice? I'm also curious to see if anyone agrees/disagrees with my theory.",2015-03-10

33,"I created a concept for a Reddit app for the Apple Watch, would love to hear some opinions and feedback on it!","#Thank you everyone for the feedback!  I've taken most of the feedback and incorporated it into a mini-redesign.  


Changes:




App has been slimmed down.  Instead of being able to choose subreddits individually you can view the front page, which contains posts from your subscribed subreddits.  Or you can view all of the posts from all subreddits.


Gone is the Apple-style home screen, replaced with a choice between the previously mentioned options.


Also yanked was the ability to view individual subreddits on the home screen.  This should help to greatly reduce the scope of the app, and pushes it slightly to be more suitable for a watch.


Front page changed yet again.  This time it is in a list view.  Gone is swiping to upvote/downvote.  Navigating up and down will be done by the digital crown.




Hello everyone!


First things first:




If there are any developers out there who would like to partner with me to make this concept into an actual app, please PM me.




The app is tentatively called Watchit.  (Watch + Reddit = Watchit.)






With that out of the way, let's get to some images.




##Front-facing mockups


####
Springboard




This is the icon for the app, surrounded by all of the apps on your device.




####
Home Screen




This is the main home screen of the app.  Here you can choose between the front page of all your subscribed to subreddits, or browse all posts from all of the subreddits.  
Note this has changed from before.




####
Front page/All page




This is the screen where most of the magic happens.  Here, the posts for the subreddit you are currently in are displayed.  This for example is how the front page might look, and this same visual style will apply to all pages.




####
Full Screen view, Upvoting/Downvoting a post




Simply tapping on a post will enlarge the picture or title of the post so you can view it as large as the screen allows.  Tapping close will bring you back to the subreddit.




####
Force Touch Context Menu




Force touching on a post will bring up a context menu where you can save the post to your Reddit account, share it, or send it to your iPhone where you can view the post within the companion iPhone app.




####
Short Look Notification




From the Apple Design Guidelines:  ""Short Looks let the user know which app received a notification and are visible only briefly."".




In the Watch app, you will be able to be notified whenever a new post becomes the top post on the front page.  The interval at which this happens can be set within the companion app.  It can update in real time whenever positions change, or for example every 30 minutes.  Whichever you choose.






####
Long look Notification (1)

####
Long Look Notification (2)
 (What you see when you scroll down)




From the Apple Design Guidelines:  ""Long Looks provide more detail about an incoming notification.""




In this app, Long Look notifications will show what the current post is (its content and its title.)  From the notification, you will be able to upvote, downvote, or save the post, as well as being able to dismiss the notification.








##Mockups of the app on some select Watch designs.


####
Here is the mockup
.  Unfortunately the template I had only had one option for the Watch and Edition models.    




tl;dr:  Created a design for a Reddit Apple Watch app.


View all the images in 
this album.




##Some info on the iPhone App.


I haven't yet designed the iPhone App that would ultimately ship with it.  The primary focus of the iPhone App would be to drive the Watch app.  When you send a post from the Watch and to your phone, you will be able to view the post on your iPhone.  I haven't decided how complex the iPhone app should be, but you'll be able to use it instead of the Watch if you so desire, with commenting, reading comments, and reading articles a stock feature.  Pricing hasn't been decided, but likely no more than $0.99.


Enjoy!

2,Ion-X or Sapphire Glass that is the question,"Well, I have all the intentions of buying an Apple Watch, but I have ran into a dilemma of durability of each model Stainless Steel vs Sport.


My very first venture into the smart watch scene was with the Pebble through Kickstarter.  I got my Pebble and enjoyed it quite a bit, until scratches started showing up on the face of the watch.


I am not really rough on watches, I just wear a watch constantly and it evidentially got scuffed up over time.  I have other watches that are sapphire crystal and the face looks immaculate to this day, but most have a bezel protecting the crystal.  


My concerns are like anyone else shattering the crystal.  I workout on an everyday basis and I always wear a watch no matter what I am doing.  I am concerned with the Ion-X and scuffing the glass up with scratches, while I am concerned shattering the sapphire glass.  


What should I do? 


I will definitely purchase Applecare upon release and give myself some piece of mind.


I have seen videos where sapphire crystal is tested and it seems very durable with certain impacts, generally the drop test seem the worse, due to the shock absorption of the sapphire glass.  I personally see myself more prone to scratching the crystal then anything, rather than impacting it; but you never know.",2015-03-17

2,[Prediction] Most Popular Apple Watch,"I am going to predict that four of the following apple watches will be the most desirable.




Watch Sport White or Black bands


Apple watch SS with white or black sport bands




I think the pricing hits a sweet spot for most consumers willing to pay for something new.


I chose white and black because they seem to be the most versatile colors to wear something with.


Women will opt for 38mm sports watch because they will likely like the lightweight 25g vs 40g 38mm from the SS Apple watch.


I also predict that the Watch Sport Black band and black watch face are so similar to the Apple watch SS with black band that to the consumer may deem the watch hard to justify the added cost simply at face value . We all know the increased quality of material etc.


My prediction is that people will start lower and buy an entry level Apple watch and upgrade their bands when necessary. Why? New category of technology to many. The functionality may not seem appealing to all. People are not in lucrative cellular contracts with credit that can be applied to a new device like an iPhone. This is definitely a luxury piece of tech. People don't know that it's not more than you need but more than they are used to. Apple and many companies are here to create that need when it doesn't really exist. That is apparent with all the mainstream skepticism on wearable technology you hear about on the news. Thus I predict it will be a slow yet very lucrative market that will complement our desires to get a new ithings every year.


These are my predictions..... What does the community think ?",2015-03-18
8,"Hey guys, would love some feedback on a tip calculator for your watch app!","Hello All!


So I've written a super simple tip calculating app with some basic features:




calculates subtotal from receipt total and tax


calculates tip on subtotal


ability to round either tip or total (or no rounding)




EDIT: more explanation on tax and tip calculations below:


       subtotal (calculated)
+           tax (from user)
= receipt total (from user)

       subtotal (calculated)
*       tip pct (from user)
=    tip amount (calculated)

  receipt total (from user)
+    tip amount (calculated)
=     total+tip (calculated)



My watch app is up and running and was just wondering what you guys thought!


Here's some photos:




Main screen
 (that blue is the actual color of all the titles)


Main screen scrolled down


Entering total/percentage


When you hit the check button


Menu at the main screen for rounding




I know it's difficult to get an idea without actually using it, but I imagine a typical use case is: user opens the app, enters total and tip percentage (tax is saved from previous or from main app), then decides whether she wants to use the displayed amounts or round. She can then force touch to access the menu and choose (current chosen option is a check while others are the X's), when she's done the app updates the values!

not well received
, mostly due to the overbearing negativity that dominates that subreddit. 


I think people here may grasp my ideas better. Enjoy


The fact of the matter is, you don't need it anymore than you need a tablet over a laptop. Or a smartphone over a flip phone. 
What the Apple Watch is in it's purest essence, is the final connection between between humans and technology. It is the final resting place that our technology will ascend (before it enters our bloodstreams and brains). 


Computers began forging their connection to us decades ago with the first PCs. Then, laptops allowed us to bring our technology first to our kitchen table and later, with increased portability, onto flights and nearly anywhere we chose. Then came tablets, which allowed us to hold the power of a laptop in our hands. Phones, (although chronologically prior to tablets) went a step further, with extreme connectedness, power, and a world of possibility slipping into your pocket. But this steady transition of technology integrating into our lives is not over yet. 


The next spot is our wrists, and it is one of the biggest issues that has existed in each advancement I named above. 
You see, as technology has gotten smaller, more powerful, and more portable, it has still been relatively unchanged in the fact that whenever you sit down at your iMac, open your MBP, or unlock your iPhone, you are sucked away from reality in the form of a glowing screen that commands your entire attention away from your surroundings.


Despite the small size of your iPhone, whenever it buzzes in your pocket, you still need to reach in, pull it out, unlock it-- and then-- you are in the device, your attention fully on the content of the screen. You may look away, but the device still has your attention (and for that matter is more likely to suck you into checking another application after you complete that task). How many tables of people have you walked past in a restaurant with their heads stuck in their phones, barely communicating? A lot, probably. The fact of the matter simply is that even though your phone screen may be small, whenever you turn it on, even for the simple task of checking the weather, you are taken out of the moment and are more likely to remain distracted.


This is where the Apple Watch comes into play. Rather than staring at the glowing rectangle of your phone, you will be able to access (as well as input) the same information as your phone with a mere glance (or a few taps) at your wrist. If you get a text, you see in on your arm (you don't have to open it; you could dismiss it by covering the watch face with your other hand if you want), and if want to respond, the watch enables you to do so with an ease and swiftness simply not available on the phone. (If you would like to type a longer or more detailed response your are welcome to take it out however)


The ability to do things like this translate to all aspects of the Apple Watch-- in other words, your technological world will blend into your physical reality as seamlessly as a glance at your wrist. And the value of this is far more than you think.


It fills the missing gap in Apple's product line-- it holds the final connection between you and your technology (and all the connectedness that comes with it) while simultaneously keeping you connected to the things that really count: your physical reality. 


Apple has come under some criticism for their lack of what many people call a ""killer feature"". Well that isn't true. The Apple Watch ""killer feature"" is how personal it is, how personal it can be (in it's myriad of customization options), and how much it will allow it's users to be more personal with their surroundings.


I know, it sounds like a joke. 


But deep down, this is what will make the Apple Watch a hit. And you know, if you don't buy it in a month it's ok. 


Because I can guarantee it that you, along with everyone else, will have one in 3 years.


Do you value time? Most people do-- many of technologies biggest hits of the past ten years are as huge as they are because they save their users more time than the old fashioned way of doing things.


You probably don't think about the amount of time it takes to reach into your pocket (or purse for that matter), grab your phone, unlock it, and then do what you intended to do/see what you intended to see on it, but those instances take up time, and that time adds up. Having the information from your phone (in addition to who even knows what else) on your wrist opens up thousands of possibilities but more importantly saves you your valuable time.


Ok.


Need to check if it's gonna rain in an hour? Raise your wrist and 3 seconds later you know to grab an umbrella.


Who won the game last night? Raise your wrist and check your Apple Watch glance widget-- 5 seconds later and you know.


Want to buy a Poweraide at a vending machine? Hold your wrist up to the sensor and 2 seconds later the transaction is complete.


Virtually every aspect of the Watch is designed to help it's users save their valuable time. And if time is money, I don't mind paying for that. (So I guess this Watch is technically paying for itself? I joke but you have to imagine the benefits)


The fact of the matter is that I could go on for hours about the notifications, the personal new ways to communicate, the endless potential for home automation, not to mention the fitness features which provide plenty of reason to buy it in and of itself. (I haven't even begun to talk about the MASSIVE, MASSIVE potential of apps on the device). 


But I won't. Because really, when you think about it, in 3 or 5 years from now, when technology has finished it's journey from our desks to our pockets to our wrists (just as actual clocks did in years past), people won't question buying an Apple Watch any more than people question buying a new pair of shoes or a new iPhone.


And if you're concerned about the pricing, dont be.


The Sport edition actually has quite the fair price when compared to other fitness bands the amount of features/ the quality of their experience. The stainless steel edition is also priced competitively when it comes to analog watches of a similar price scale (and it looks just as good). And obsolescence is certainly something to consider, but 
I urge you to look past our current tech outlook.
 With the Apple Watch applications mostly being run on the iPhone, I don't think we should expect to see increasing performance issues as the years pass by in the same way we do on iPhones. Expect to get between 3-5 years out of you Apple Watch (Apple could potentially even replace your battery for you). You may not want to upgrade your Watch that often but when these things hit mainstream, get used to it (after all, we replace our smartphones without little fuss every 2-3 years). But expect your second purchase Apple Watch to 
much improved
 from your first, i.e. with countless biometric sensors and more. 


There is also the exciting potential that a later model could be sold by health insurance companies at a subsidy in the same way as iPhones were once they gained 3G-- with a smaller down payment with the rest of the Watch being paid off in your healthcare bill over time. Think prices along the lines of $99 for the Sport, $199 for the Watch and (cough) $3,000 for the Edition.


 And the $10,000 Edition? Don't get your panties in a bunch regarding those-- they aren't aimed towards people like us; they're just a clever way to raise the overall status and appeal of all the Apple Watches as a whole.


So buy it now, or don't. But if you choose to wait, I look forward to hearing about your wonderful experiences with the 2017 Apple Watch Sport. Because we are just on the tip of the iceberg for these babies.


Cheers.


TLDR: The Apple Watch will add value to your life in ways that cannot be measured such as reconnecting you to reality, saving you time, and overall improving your quality of life. Oh yeah, and it looks as good too.

nobody was sleeping, not even the (magic) mouse,


all were on iPhones and iPad air 2s,


on Macbook and iMacs and Mac minis too,


all had their favorite watches selected.

now iCan't do poems so I shall stop now,


and get to the text post you all wanted...sh*t, what rhymes with now...?


So the apple watch is about to be out and I want to make and hear your predictions (both big and small) about the Watch 2 or S or whatever. I have my money on 3 things:


1, Apple watches will be few and far between: because of a $10,000  gold apple watch, if there is a 2016 $10,000 Watch edition S, apple will have dug themselves into a hole. If they do a trade in program, they will show how much the gold watches are really worth. I say they will release them with every 2 or even 4 iPhones. The iPhone 6 gets one so the Watch 2 will launch with the iPhone 7 or iPhone 8.


2, MAJOR redesign for each apple watch: going back to $10,000 for an apple watch, there better be a reason for plunking down another 10k or even 500 for the same goddamn thing with a different charging port or a camera.


3, The Watch will probably follow in the iPad's footsteps. This is what I have the most money on. With it getting better and better and the interest just falling off.

1,Avoiding the Tyranny of Notifications?,"Like many of you, I'm thinking about getting an Apple Watch sometime this year.


I work at a software company (where we naturally have quite a few early adopters) and I've seen a few people now wandering around with smart watches of one kind or another. There have been some interesting ones, although the more I see them, the more I think that Apple's design is the least ""gadgety"", which is probably a good thing.


I mention this because a collague was showing me her watch on Friday (I think it's the new Samsung Galaxy Gear) with Android Wear on it. It was fairly smooth/fluid and such, and looked to work well enough (although it had a heart attack when she got too far from her phone...)


But what was interesting was that she pretty much had all of her phone notifications going to her wrist. She thought this was convenient. I said to her ""Yes, it's a great idea, but sometimes I want to deliberately put my phone in a drawer or leave it on my desk, because I 
don't
 necessarily want to be notified all the time about everything.""


I already feel that with a smart phone, I've become (like many others) fairly bound to the idea of constant notifications. I'm used to it, and being without it feels weird. At the same time, I'm now starting to limit what apps can notify me - even on my phone - because I'm kind of tired of being constantly bombarded by alerts about everything all the time.


So, in terms of the Apple Watch, I'm thinking that when I get one I will probably keep the notifications as minimal as possible. Aside from perhaps text messages and calendar alerts/reminders, I may restrict pretty much everything else - possibly even phone calls, come to think of it.


I'm curious to know: for those of you who are looking to get one of these, and who are otherwise new to the smart watch phenomenon...what's your view on notifications? Will you have all of your phone notifications coming to the watch, or only a subset? 


I'm starting to think that unless I deliberately do this restriction, I'm just going to be 
constantly
 subject to being contacted by apps, which isn't necessarily convenient or desirable for me.

2,Will AppleCare protect against water damage?,"Now that Apple has 
officially given the Apple Watch an IPX7 rating
, would Apple repair watches under AppleCare if they were damaged from taking a shower?  


I'd say this is a pretty important question considering most people are concerned (and excited) about taking such a pricey gadget in the shower with them.  


For those who don't have the 
International Protection Marking Code index;
 memorized, IPX7 refers to #7 of the Liquid ingress protection code.  #7 states:  


Ingress of water in harmful quantity shall not be possible when the enclosure is immersed in water under defined conditions of pressure and time (up to 1 m of submersion).
 


It further states that, ""
Test duration: 30 minutes
The lowest point of enclosures with a height less than 850 mm is located 1000 mm below the surface of the water, the highest point of enclosures with a height equal to or greater than 850 mm is located 150 mm below the surface of the water.
""  


Clearly this sounds like it will protect against shower use but do IP rating codes vouch safe for warranties?  


I think somehow that it would not, but considering the amount of people that will attempt a shower with their watch bares consideration, especially if 
Tim Cook is publicly mentioning doing it
.  


As a random side note:
I use an 
ECOPEBBLE Bluetooth Speaker
 in my shower.  The company carries many products and considers them ALL ""
Waterproof. Fully submersible in Water
"", except the only speaker displaying an IP rating for is the Pebble, which as you can see in the link is IPX7.  I haven't been using it very long but it works 'okay', but when water gets sprayed into the speaker it can have intermittent sound loss, almost like popping.  So take that for what you will.

As we get closer to preorder and launch dates, I know I'd rather just be seeing new articles and news involving the Apple Watch.  Seeing these same questions posted over and over is mildly annoying, and I don't think I'm the only one who feels this way.


Maybe at least we could have a couple common posts stickied to the front page, such as the ""Which model/combo are you getting?"" thread.  It's not that I think these threads are pointless, I just think it's pointless to have multiple posts about the same topic.",2015-04-03

I really wish Apple made optional bands with space black attachment parts.

It  makes me wonder how small the 38 is in person. So I have 2 questions: 




Is it plausible to preorder the same watch in both sizes, check out the watches in the store that morning, and cancel the order I don't want? 




Any photos/info that might make me feel more comfortable about the size of the 38?

I don't want to wait for version two, because I've wanted the Watch since September. But, if Apple announces the Watch and you're comfortable going about 2 months without a watch till Version 2 comes out, will the product hold its value well?


Also, a side note, but some people say they will buy the Sport instead of the Stainless Steel, but if I'm going to wear something on my wrist for a year and interact with it daily, I think it's worth it to still buy the one that I personally like.

I am certain I am not the only one who sees this as an issue. I do not enjoy iPhones without a jailbreak and the prospect of losing the break, particularly given another one looks a while off with Apple patching a lot of exploits in 8.3, is a concerning trade off to getting the watch.

14,An Apple Watch App I Think Is Useful - disclaimer I made it :),"So the idea is, and I know you've likely experienced this, you are sitting in the movie theater wondering ""How much longer is left in this movie?!""  


With the newly approved 
Movie Hype
 app extension for Apple Watch you can wonder no more! (trying to sound like Billy Mays here) 


The watch app knows the runtime of all in theater and recent in home movie releases. Simply select the movie you are watching and the watch will display a running countdown timer with the exact length of the film. 


A quick glance at your wrist will let you know the time left so you can adjust your seating position or go grab a quick snack. 


Future enhancements to the watch app include customized alerts of interesting facts pertaining to the film as they occur  on screen and haptic feedback indicating a good time to relieve yourself when a lull in the action is about to occur.

One of my biggest issues with Reminders on iPhone is how often I miss the fucking alerts because I don't notice them in my pocket. 


Reminders seems perfectly suited for the Watch. View simple lists, add to or edit the list with Siri, remind at times or locations, etc... I don't understand how that wouldn't be an essential function of the platform. 


I'm pretty stunned it's nowhere to be found and I don't see anyone mentioning its absence in reviews or anywhere else. Feel like I'm missing something or going crazy, but surely other people care about this, right?",2015-04-11

Unfortunately I wasn't able to actually see the Space Gray with the Black Leather loop in person, the store I went to wasn't allowing any mixing/matching of bands/faces.

I pre-ordered the 38mm Sport and was scared that it was too small, feminine, whatever but after trying both on I was so glad I went with the smaller one. The screen looks fine, and it doesn't feel too small at all. It seems to compliment my wrists well and I like that it's a little more of a subtle design on my wrist. Thought I'd share cause I saw a lot of men with small wrists here conflicted.

7,Woo Hoo!,"I tried on a SS 42 mm with black sport band today at the local Apple store.  (The same model I pre-ordered.)  Loved the feel and look.  


The Apple employee swapped out several bands for me.  My favorites were the sport with its soft, almost fuzzy, texture and the black, classic buckle.  The Milianese loop was snazzy and I loved the magnetic closure, but I'm not a metal band guy.  I didn't like the feel or appearance of the segmented, leather loop.  The perfect band for dress occassions might be the simple leather of the classic but with a magnetic closure.

1,Just got back from my try on session. 42mm SS with Milanese loop.,"I have 190mm wrist, and this watch fit perfectly. The weight felt like that of a quality watch, the sapphire screen was a dream to touch, the digital crown felt really natural, and the haptic feedback was incredibly subtle and discreet. The heart rate thing on the bottom didn't seem to add much, if any elevation off my wrist. 
The band was amazing. It was light weight, flexible, and the magnet is very strong. I don't anticipate it slipping at all. 
As an added bonus, the lady asked what my ship date was and I told her I got the 24th and she told me that I'm only the second person that she's talked to who got that date. Then again I'm not incredibly surprised. There've only been a handful of people in my area that seem to be interested in the watch (I work for an electronics retailer, so the quarry come up often), and Sacramento isn't quite Cupertino after all.

pick the set of up to 2GB of music you'd want to store


pick a set of photos worthy of having on your watch at all times


adjust music track names shorter if you have really long ones, like for classical music


clean up contact info so outdated addresses and phone numbers don't get accidentally selected for calling / texting / directions


perhaps adjust current iPhone notification settings, e.g: my phone displays ""text message"" instead of showing it, for privacy. But now I don't have to unlock my phone to read it, since I'm not concerned about that privacy when a watch is attached to my wrist

5,Have You Ever Stood On Line For A Product?,"I'm just asking because there are some people who seem to want this situation, some who are against it. I had stood on line for an iPhone 4 (iirc) at the NYC 5th Ave store. It was a pleasant experience.


Fastforward to last fall. I got an iPhone 6+ a bit after launch through ATT, which was then stolen. After asking an Apple employee at the SoHo NYC store if they would have stock (and being told they did, every day, get a new shipment) I stood on line for 
four days in a row
, getting there at 6am to 7am, only to be told after a wait of one to four hours that I could not get a phone - save for the last day, after four or five hours, when I was one of the lucky few who did get a phone.


The line was mostly filled with people on vacation and foreign buyers who seemed like they were taking orders for other people. Regardless, this was well after the iPhone 6+ and iPhone 6 launch, and simply going to the store to get a phone was a horrible experience. And I needed a phone, so I had to do this every day until it worked. You could not order a phone online and request store pickup because they were always marked as shipping in X weeks. I was told you could try refreshing the page at midnight and it may update; it did not.


I know it sucks to get a late ship date, but the online order process for the Apple Watch seems a billion times better than the hell (I mean, relatively speaking) I went through to get a supply constrained iPhone.",2015-04-17

0,Sizing tip with the Apple Store App previews,"Had a try-on appointment today, as well as a realisation.


Everyone has pointed out the the Watch seems way smaller in person - true! But, how small?


I found that comparing the two side by side, the scale image of the 38mm Watch seems the same as the real 42mm.


Totally an illusion, but if you haven't been able to make it in to a store to see the Watch in person, there's a pretty decent reference for you.",2015-04-18
3,What are your thoughts/plans for Gen 2?,"While we're waiting I've done some thinking some about Gen 2.  


Listening to the reviews I've come to the following guesses:




We've got two years until a refresh.




Built-in GPS




Thinner




Larger HD (will become necessary with native third party apps.)




Faster (though this will also be due to software optimization.)




Increased Battery Capacity (mostly counteracted by the previous changes leading to a similar functional battery life.)




Maybe a camera?






What I'm less certain of is where that will leave the first model?  Do you think Apple will offer any kind of buy-back plan?  Will a thinner be backwards compatible in terms of bands?


(Obviously we're guessing here, but I'd love to hear some speculation.)

0,Changing watch face colours,"I just used a watch in the store and I'd like to know how the same team that made the excellent overall Watch UI was also responsible for this usability nightmare? 


Changing the colour of the second hand is easy enough because each colour slides out from the top as you scroll (although it's finicky because you can never tell if you've gone far enough to get to the new colour or revert back), but whoever decided changing the background colour of the face would work by scrolling through hues and locking you on a single one is an idiot. It's impossible to tell when you've reached a new colour, and half the time after I scrolled from, say, blue to a lighter blue, it would just reset back to dark blue if I released the crown, or jump way ahead to yellow. It's even worse on the Chrono face, where the colours are so subtle it's almost impossible to tell which ones are ""allowed"".


Did anyone else feel the same way? I'd really like to know what Jony and Kevin were smoking when they approved this, and the solution (just scroll through binary colour options) is 
so
 painfully obvious. I really hope Apple changes this because if you ever feel like you're fighting 
against
 the user interface, something is very, very wrong.",2015-04-18

107,Old woman's opinion on Watch just seen,"Saw the watch yesterday... Micky taps the foot that his hand is pointing to. i.e. Left hand pointing left, left foot taps.
I liked the feel of the 42"" sport that I bought. I liked the sport band better than the mesh one. I really like the accessibilty stuff, since I'm almost 70 and my legally blind DH is 91.The large time display is what I'll try for him. Changing colors may help, too. The tap was very light, so I'll hope the increased one is stronger.
I am hoping that the watch will let me get out of the house more... take walks in our WiFi envelope, garden, etc. We can get calls on the iPhone and even if it's inside in my purse I can answer on the Watch. My MD DD is getting one so she won't be disturbed when she is with patients, but knows to check her messages between appts.  I'm looking forward to 'playing' with it's features, too",2015-04-18
10,Make us hope! Share your stories!,"So before the Apple Watch it never seemed to be a problem to get any new product in the rural area of Germany I live in.


Just one example: my girlfriend ordered the iPhone 6 from T-Mobile and got it on release day. I really liked it so a few days later I just walked in a shop and bought one without the need to search first!


But with the Apple Watch this seems to have changed. I intentionally stayed at home longer on the 10. of April to be able to order the Watch in time. I orderes the black Sport as soon as the app was online. Still 4-6 weeks wait.


And this wait is soul crushing!

I personally think the modern buckle looks super smexy and isn't just for females. It's not overwhelming but not to dull. It's got just the right amount of clean, simplistic design that just looks really nice and just feels really great too! What do you think? Should Apple make a 42mm modern buckle band?",2015-04-19

So I figured I'd fund the purchase by writing an app.


I came up with ""save this location and help me get back"" -- probably most useful for parking at stadiums or malls, but maybe also useful for camping or ""if we get separated, meet back here"" or ""I buried the treasure chest here, yaaargh.""


The app is now live in the App Store and free. The price goes to $0.99 on Friday to (hopefully) recoup my Watch purchase (best case: Facebook buys the app for $2B; worst case, my Watch is a tax write-off).

Locator Plus

You can download the app before you have a Watch; once you have the app future updates are free and it's easy to add it to your watch in a day or a year.

2,Observation and Good News For All Second Batch Pre-Orders,"So we've all noticed that some people in the first batch have started getting confirmation of shipment... but some people in this first batch haven't gotten confirmation

 (
http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/04/20/apple-starts-charging-apple-watch-orders-preparing-units-for-shipping
)


This is rather odd, right? You would think a big company like Apple would respect the order at which customers placed their orders. Assuming Apple IS respecting this order we can only conclude one thing...


Therefore: Since some first batch people and a few second batch people have gotten confirmation of shipment, while others in the first batch still have not, we can only conclude that Apple has allowed this to happen because the order DOESN'T MATTER. In other words, first and second batches should be expected to arrive on launch day or soon after",2015-04-21

5,(SS vs Aluminum) Does it bother anyone else...?,"As someone in the design field (architect), something has bothered me at the in store displays, the try on appointments, and on the may pictures that have been posted here, and I couldn't really figure out why until recently. 


The case materials have traditionally gotten more matte and brushed as time goes on and models iterate. The model line of iphones went from a shiny chrome accent (the 3?) to matte metal with the 5/5s/6.


Is this old language stuck in anyone else's head? I ordered a SS just because I know it'a more dressy, but I can't help but feel that the sport with a non-sport band seems more modern. 


Does anyone else think the plain SS looks dated or very obviously first gen because of this? The matte aluminium looks more timeless to me.


Conjuring up crappy fake chrome edges on like all samsung products. 


I guess I have to trust apple in their planned use of materials for future watches, but this one threw me for a loop.

Hello all,
I am making this thread because I really would appreciate your help with something - unlocking the Apple Watch companion app for anyone without a physical watch. I think it would be nice for people, including myself, to get familiar with it before they start using it with the watch. So, anyone who does own a watch, I would appreciate you doing this for me, and the community.


1.) Download iBackupBot for your computer (trust me, it's safe, I use it all the time).
2.) Plug in your iPhone, and make a backup of your iPhone that is paired with your watch to iTunes (locally).
3.) Open iBackupBot, and on the left sidebar, navigate to System Files --> HomeDomain --> Library --> Preferences, and find the file ""com.apple.Bridge.plist"".
4.) Right click on that file, and select export.
5.) Post a link (or PM me if you're not comfortable) to the file. Or, just copy the contents of it (double click, and click cancel when the registration window appears, you don't actually have to register).


Once I have that file, I will be able to add a key (BOOL) to other peoples', and therefore unlocking the app! The main problem here, is that I do not know what the bool is, but anyone who is paired with a watch, has it. Thank you!


So if anyone can help him (and me) out then thanks a ton!

17,Golfing with the Apple Watch vs the iPhone,"Played my first round with the Watch this morning. It was incredible. I used the Golf Pad app, it's free.  So much easier to double tap the crown and glance at your wrist for yardage and shot tracking. After a ~5 hour round the battery decreased less than 20 percent!


Previously, I would use a Fun Golf GPS app for the iPhone. The app is compatible with Apple Watch but that feature is not free. I hated using my phone during play. It was annoying to swing with a big iPhone 6 pocket. Also, it was prone to scratching from tee and balls. Keeping in the golf cart was never ideal either. Not to mention, I was unable to use the phone with a glove on. After an 18 hole round my iPhone battery would often be down as much as 50%. Today, with the company of the Watch, my iPhones battery declined 25% max! 


To compare, colored versions of Garmin GPS watches cost upwards of $500, which is more than the SS edition. 


Now I'm just waiting for developers to make apps for swing analysis.",2015-04-27

1,Apple Watch First Day Experience + Unboxing,"So, after what seems like a long wait I now have my 38mm Apple Watch with Black Sport Band on my wrist and so far I am really happy with it.  A couple days ago I made a request to have UPS hold the package for me so I could pick it up Monday morning.  This ended up working out great and I was able to pick it up at 8:00AM.  However, I only had about an hour and a half to get it unboxed, set it up, and play with it.  With that said I still don’t know everything that this thing is capable of.  Anyways, I’ll get on with a review where I kind of split all of the notable features up and discuss my experience.  Keep in mind that, like I said, I haven’t even played with it for a full day yet, so there is much to be experienced and learned about this thing.


Feel and Comfortability - 10/10

So, this is a big one!  Something that is uncomfortable, no matter how useful, won’t be worth any set of features in the long run.  This thing, however, is insanely comfortable!  I haven’t worn a watch since I was in middle school and it didn’t take long to get used to it at all.  I was a little worried about the heart rate sensor causing discomfort against my wrist, but it’s quite the opposite.  When I first put it on I had the band a bit too tight, so when I started walking around and the blood went into my arms it felt like it was restricting blood flow, but I simply went down one adjustment and I no longer feel the restriction and it hasn’t moved around hardly at all.


Another thing many people have been worried about is the weight.  This isn’t a weight that makes it feel like you’re dragging your arm around by any means.  For me, it actually just adds to the premium feel and it really feels like a nice watch should.  If you really can’t stand the weight, then you may want to go with the Sport, but I don’t think you’ll feel much of a difference.


Material Quality - 9/10

This thing is really nice.  The display is fantastic!  The sport band doesn’t feel like plastic or rubber as some have described it.  The stainless steel finish is really nice and I haven’t noticed any scratching yet.  There probably is some scratching, but it’s not really noticeable from a normal viewing distance, so I’m not at all worried about it.  The digital crown scrolls so smoothly and fluidly.  Overall, it’s just really nice to have the premium materials and sapphire display as a bit of insurance against damage that may occur over time on a device that will see the elements on a day to day basis for at least a few years.  It all comes together very nicely and looks really fantastic.  The only reason I docked a point on this one was because it’s not made of gold, but really this is pretty much a 10/10.


Notifications - 7/10

Receiving notifications on your wrist is probably going to be the most often used feature on this Watch.  It’s certainly the first thing that I noticed when I got it.  I was getting notifications from Alien Blue on my wrist and it was fantastic.  This holds true with pretty much any other app.  Being able to dismiss unimportant things without having to take my phone out of my pocket is great and disturbs people around me a lot less when I’m in class.  With that said, I think there is much to be desired.  Actionable notifications are limited at the moment and you have to switch to the app for replies in messages.  It’s pretty good as is, but could use some work.


Glances - 6/10

At the moment glances work pretty well.  It’s a nice way to get some information quickly without needing to view the full app.  So, they are what they are, but I didn’t rate them very highly due to it feeling a bit cluttered to me.  I think they’ll just take some getting used to, but I think there’s something left to be desired here.


Watch Faces - 8/10

These are great!  I am really starting to see that this rectangular screen is much more useful than a round one.  You can still have a classic circular watch face, but all kinds of little complications in the corners and it’s just a lot more useable space.  I have only messed around with two watch faces at the moment mainly due to the limited amount of time I’ve had, but there’s really a watch face for just about any occasion.  The only reason I didn’t give it 10/10 is because I think that it should be opened up for developers to tap into.  Not even necessarily completely new watch faces, but basically allowing apps to display their own complications on the preexisting watch faces would be awesome.


Sound and Haptics - 9/10

This is definitely one of the coolest features to look forward to if you don’t already have an Apple Watch.  The Taptic engine really does feel like a tap on the wrist and it works really well.  By itself, it makes absolutely no sound and it’s not at all annoying like a vibration can be.  I’ve run into a couple of times where I either didn’t feel the tap enough to raise my attention, but there were also times when I felt a tap that didn’t really exist.  Most of the time it works really well, but a lot of it probably has to do with the band that you have.  I am thinking about getting the milanese loop and that was the most comfortable band that I was able to try on during my try on session.  I also think it would work better since it keeps the Watch a bit closer to your wrist than the sport band.


The sounds right off the bat definitely weren’t too bad.  The sound it made really fit with the taps and it wasn’t like a disturbing sound or anything.  However, I silenced this thing within the first hour I got it.  I don’t want to be disturbing people around me all day…that’s what the Taptic engine is for!  I haven’t really tested any other audio capabilities, so that’s to come I guess.


Battery - 9/10

In my limited first day of testing the Apple Watch has fared very well in terms of battery.  I’ve been using it at almost every chance that I get and I only got it up to ~90% when I started my day at 10AM.  It’s 6:45PM as of writing this and it’s at 35%, so it’s gotten a lot of use and has been off the charger for almost 9 hours.  I’m finding that it’s losing an average of ~6% an hour.  If this had a full charge I would bet it could last me at least 16 hours with heavy usage.  On a normal day it could probably meet or exceed Apple’s standard of 18 hours.  When I plugged it in after the unboxing I found that it was charging at about 1% per minute, so it shouldn’t take more than 2 hours to charge it up from 0%.  I would say that I only require a maximum of 15 hours of battery on a normal day though, so I’m not at all concerned with the battery life and throwing it on the charger at night just doesn’t faze me as that big of a deal.  So, from my standpoint, the battery life is great!


Overall - 9/10

In almost all the categories I have looked at so far, this thing has met or exceeded my expectations and over time it will probably only get better with updates.  There are some bugs and little kinks that need to be worked out, but nothing that would make it anywhere close to unusable for the time being.  I didn’t rate workouts since I didn’t have the chance to take a look at this today, but I’ll probably go for a run in the morning.  Most everything seems to be working great and I’m really excited to spend more time working with it and see what it’s capable of.

I'm just wondering if I had to sign for it personally or if anyone can sign for it. I'm kind of paranoid about the UPS guy not being able to deliver it and taking it back and after waiting so long I don't want that to happen.

0,Some known issues | Addressed with Apple | Logs sent to Engineering Team,"Hey guys, so I got my 38MM SG Watch and I am in love with the product. Definitely worth the long wait.


However, there were some known issues I noticed and I will outline them below. 


Loud ""Click"" coming from the device when being tapped. This was ONLY when I was being tapped or when someone was exchanging their heartbeat with me. Apple said it was not a big issue, but they said to continue to monitor it.


The NEW and probably the most significant issue was discovered today while inside the Virtual Setup appointment with an Apple Specialist. 


There were multiple occasions where I would be typing at my desk, or resting my hand on any flat surface and the display would actually turn on. A few significant cases: Where I was standing and I would hold out my arm flat, the watch would turn on. At my desk or simple movements touching a doorknob or shaking someones hand would turn on the display. 


Talked with a Senior Apple Care Specialist and they simply sent off diagnostic logs to the engineering team and they will get back to me within 48 hours. 


Overall, no performance issues, but just detection issues where it thinks I am looking at my watch when I am not.


EDIT: Just thought I would share here incase anyone else had experienced this.",2015-05-03
3,It works find on the underside of the wrist,"I just got my Apple Watch today (CL, not from Apple*, sadly) and I'm happy as hell to report that the Watch works fine worn on the underside of the wrist.   


Heart rate? Perfectly fine.   The heart rate glance had no problems.  I also used the activity app when I took the dogs for a walk and there were no issues at all.   


There are a few oddities, though:  The motion to turn the watch face on is finicky and works best when I'm standing up, but not that good when I'm sitting down.   No biggie for me, though.


One interesting thing:  It was getting dark while walking the dogs, and I just so happened to randomly glance at my wrist.  I saw a weird green glow coming from under the watch.  It took me a minute to realize they were the green LED's used to measure the heart rate.   They were on and visible the entire time, heh.

My current settings are to mirror my phone and my phone is set to allow notifications, play tone, show badge on app, show banner, and allow notifications on lock screen.

2,One day in...42mm SG,"First full day with the watch. Went from 10a to 12 midnight with about 11% left. Heavy use, from checking messages, emails, and using it for directions. Not to mention letting my family use it and showing them how it works. Happy with battery life so far, but we'll see how it fares during the week.


I didn't really notice third party app lag. It's there, but the amount of time is so minuscule that it didn't bother me at all.


The activity feature is great. It was pretty warm today, and normally it would deter me from being active as I hate heat, however I did want to see how much work would be involved in completing those circles. As a motivational feature this is great. I hope I can keep doing this daily.


Overall, I'm pleased. I looked at my phone less than I normally do, and I'm ALWAYS on my phone. I get a notification and with a quick glance I can determine if I want to deal with it now, later, or not at all. I'm still connected but it's so much less intrusive than it normally is to me.


Using Apple Pay on it sparked a lot of questions today as well. Probably the neatest feature on the watch. Pretty damn convenient. Glad I got one. If you're still processing and the wait is killing you, be patient. It's definitely worth it.",2015-05-03

19,1 week review,"There are many reviews of the Apple Watch on here so I'll keep it brief to what I have found helpful. 


I've been using a Pebble for over a year now. I would use it to tell the time, to change music while driving or at home, and to view and dismiss notifications. 


What is great about the Apple Watch for me is that it's a very active device. With the Pebble, I would see the notification first on my wrist and then have to pull out my phone if I wanted to respond. With the Apple Watch, I can easily send a response quickly using Siri, or even archive a quick email, for example. This alone has made this thing great in my every day life. 


The Activity app I thought would be a gimmick but it actually motivates me to get out more. I'm a runner and it has pushed me to run further, more so than any app or any device that I have used before. I stand a lot at my job, and every once in a while it would remind me to stand when in fact in that moment I was standing. Over time this would get less frequent once it learned my behaviors but it was annoying the first several days this happened. 


I have never had issues with raise to wake. When I am laying down and I raise the watch to see the time, sometimes it doesn't turn on for the angle I am in and I have learned to just tap the screen against my nose to wake it really quick if my other hand isn't accessible to see the time or notifications.


I had issues with the taptic engine the first several days. With my Pebble, I had the ""Vibrate on Ring"" and ""Vibrate on Silent"" disabled on my iPhone under the Sounds setting since my pebble would vibrate instead. No need for my iPhone to vibrate as well. This actually disabled the Apple Watch from vibrating as well. Once I figure this out I never had issues with the taptic engine. 


What is nice about the taptic engine is how soft it is. It's not overpowered. With the pebble it was loud and full throttle always. If I am active, that generally means I am busy and therefore wouldn't want to respond to notifications anyways. With the Apple Watch, I wouldn't feel a vibration during these times like I would with my Pebble. Therefore, the Apple Watch distracted me less than my Pebble during these moments. At first it bothered me that I didn't feel everything always, but I grew to like it. Since after these moments I'd check the time anyways and at that moment I would see that I had notifications and I could go from there. 


Battery life hasn't been an issues for me yet. I'm up between 16 and 18 hours every day and by the end of the day it's in the 20-30% battery left range. Perfect.

The watch face is stuck at night even when you scroll with the Digital Crown but I think I've found a fix. By turning off Locations Services for Apple Watch Faces under Privacy on your iPhone it should make it work like it's supposed to. The problem now is that your watch can't locate you in the Astronomy watch face. So until Apple fixes this issue you can turn it back on.

Basically my problem is my corporate email account, which uses Gmail, will not push notifications through to the watch/phone. I have to open the app and ""fetch"" them manually. I used the Gmail iPhone app before and it always pushed emails through the moment they came in. If the default Apple mail app can't push my email notifications through, then it completely defeats the purpose of the watch in my opinion. In my iPhone mail notification settings it doesn't even give me the option to push them through, just fetch every 15 minutes (which doesn't work for me) and manual.

5,Using a 42mm Leather Loop on 38mm Watch,"So, today I realized that the 42mm Leather Loop fits on the 38mm watch, with 
only slight protrusions in the four corners
.


I really like the design and functionality of the LL, and would like to use it on my 38, but I have no leatherworking skills.  


Has anybody cut down/modified their leather loop to better fit on the 38?  If so, what techniques did you use?  Any idea how Apple polished the edges of the leather loop?


Update: 
Results from filing the corners
.  The finish on the sides is a bit off, and I need to file a few pieces of debris and a bit more, but I'll grab some black shoe polish tonight after the gym.  Right now, I don't think that anybody will notice unless they are a few inches from my arm.  Over time, as both the Watch and the LL get scuffed up, it's probably going to blend in even more.


No metal was encountered during filing, the corners appear to be entirely leather.


Update 2: When I polished this tonight, I noticed that the corners aren't entirely leather - they were leather wrapped around some kind of black plastic.  So, it's not possible to get a perfect polished finish due to different materials being used.  But in almost all lighting conditions, nobody is really going to notice.  If anybody else does this, I recommend not cutting with a razor blade (that's what I did on the shorter piece).  Instead, sand down very slowly and with great care.


Update 3: The leather around the black plastic is fraying a bit, so I'm ordering the black Edge Kote mentioned in one of the comments and plan to apply it to seal the corners.


Update 4: The Edge Kote did the trick!  It dried a bit shinier than I expected, but it looks better than the raw black plastic piece.",2015-05-09

Not long, mind you, but still. Anyway, I live in California so the Watch went on sale at midnight here. I didn't want to stay up late because I get up early for work.


So, I thought, I will just order it in the morning. No big deal. I'm sure ordering 5 hours after the launch will be plenty early. Little did I know. However, my wife, as she does from time to time, awoke in the middle of the night. So, it being 2 a.m., she decided to order her Watch. She assumed I stayed up to order mine at midnight. That's why she didn't wake me up to order mine.


Her Watch arrived today. Mine? Processing. Earliest delivery is May 29, latest is June 11. It's only a couple weeks. But, I am not going to lie. I'm bummed.


On the other hand, I should be able to get her to return text messages more quickly now. :)

Order a SS BSB


Receive SS BSB


Request Milanese band exchange


(Optional) Return the BSB for a $50 refund.




Whoo! I've had the best luck. Got my watch exactly 58 hours after I placed the order. 38mm SS BSB. East Coast USA. Ordered 5/10 2 AM, came 5/12 12 PM.


My Milanese loop is shipped within 12 hours of requesting the exchange. Requested yesterday at 7 PM, was shipped as of this morning via UPS Ground. However, I'm 2 hours away from Harrisburg so it's still coming tomorrow!
(Exchange requests are way faster than a regular band order, I believe all of them except LB are shipping fast, almost immediately)


And the 38mm SS Milanese I ordered a week before I ordered the BSB is still processing!! I knew going for the BSB and then exchanging the band would be faster.


So if anyone wants a 38mm SS Milanese without waiting..... that's how!


Edit: Forgot to mention if you paid with Paypal or a gift card, this doesn't work. They won't let you return/replace the band. And you can't get an Apple Watch tier band if you bought a Sport watch originally.

I was one of the lucky guys to be charged and shipped today, and my order time was XX:12:02. I managed to get the Serial off my upcoming watch and ran it against the chipmunk database. 


And these were my findings. As you can see, and what I found the most interesting is the fact that the watch was manufactured in May, which lead me to confirm that indeed the 42mm SGS watch was underproduced and the first batch of watches didn't even cover up to the first 12 minutes of pre-ordering. 


I'm not a CSI genius like some of you, but here's the intel so you can make out things. I don't even know when week 19 was, but it has to be in the last 15 days definitely.

)  Clearly, the iPhone was capable of running more sophisticated native software, but Apple restricted its SDK instead.  It's certainly similar to the Watch's development scene, which also doesn't allow native apps or access to the device's internals despite it being quite capable.  However, this time perhaps it truly is a technological barrier to be resolved in Watch rev. 2 instead of a philosophical one with the iPhone.

(3) April 10th 12:01 AM PT - SS ML 42mm

(8) May 12th - SS PMB 38mm
(9) May 13th - SS WSB 38mm
(10) May 14th - SS WSB 38mm


So I woke up on April 10th and really wanted (1) and (2) for my wife and I.  At the times above, I ordered (1) and then (2), but realized that (1) wouldn't deliver until Mid-May, so I ordered (3) so I could have a watch on April 24th and see if I really liked the watch.  I realized, though, that I ordered (2) with ApplePay and my billing address was wrong so I also ordered (4) with the right address, and I also realized that I ordered (1) without a gift card I was meaning to use so I ordered (5).


My wife and I receive (2), (3), and (4) on April 24th and we love them.  I end up putting (4) on eBay and sold it for $510 (purchased at $376 after taxes.. $100 profit).  My wife, liking the AWS, wishes she could have a SS case since she likes the different bands.  So, we return (2) and order (6).  A few days later, she really wants a sleep number bed so she asks me to cancel (6) so I do.  As a surprise since she was willing to sacrifice her watch for a bed for her bad back, I order (7).  Apple immediately cancels (7), citing that I've ordered too many watches per house hold.  


The return period for (3) was going to expire on May 8th, so instead of just returning it, I list it on eBay (as used) and sell the $750 watch for $1100 ($250 profit).


I try again on May 12th with (8) and the order sticks.


At this time, (1) and (5) have arrived, and I list (1) on eBay since (5) was used with the gift card and thats the one I want to keep.  This watch sells within a day or two ($1060 watch, sold for $1400, $200 profit).


Realizing that my wife was fine with the WSB but just wanted the SS case, I cancel (8) and purchase (9) only to have Apple's automated system's instantly cancel my order.  I wait another day and have purchased (10), this order does not get canceled and is looking to deliver on June 3rd.


tl;dr: I ordered 10 watches, a few were canceled, and a few were sold on eBay.  I ended up getting a SS LB watch for myself through eBay profits and a gift card for about $50.",2015-05-17

4,Average difference between estimated and actual shipping dates,"I don't think I've seen anything exactly like this around yet, so I figured I'd start it.


Now that watches have been shipping for a while, I was wanting to try to collect examples of what people's estimated shipping dates were compared to when their watch arrived, so we can get a feel for how well Apple is beating expectations (and see if there are any patterns).


For example (made up):
Estimate: May 13-27
Shipped, delivered on May 10
(thus beating the estimate by 3 days)


I'm mainly curious in general what the average is, but also slightly because my estimate is May 29-June 11, and I go out of town for a week on May 26th. I'm wondering if there's a chance I'll get it before I leave, or during/after.


The model probably has some to do with it too. So I guess mine would be:

Active: 1050
Resting: 2872
Total: 3922


This seems like an awful lot of calories in total, boosted by the resting calories? It just doesn't seem right. It's been similar on other days, when I go running.  I am overweight, so I know I burn more calories than a fitter, slimmer person might when they are active, but around 4,000 total every day I exercise?!

0,"No screenshots when battery is low? (or: ""[un]pleasant surprise in the battery life department"")","Last night I put my watch on the charger just before bed, as usual. What I failed to realize was that I didn't plug my charger back in to a power source after an overnight trip. I realized this when I scrolled past my battery glance around 11am today and it showed 28% battery remaining.


So I thought I'd take the opportunity as a test of the battery. I did take it a little easier on the watch, knowing I wanted it to last, but I decided I was going to avoid power reserve mode and just see how long it would last. I just put it on the charger (plugged in this time!) at 1% charge at 8:30 pm. That's about 36 hours off Friday night's charge.


Anyway, in going to take a screen shot for this past, I noticed it would not take a screenshot and instead gave me haptic feedback (three quick touches, if I remember right) when I would attempt a screenshot. I hadn't heard anything about screenshots not working when the battery was low, so I thought I'd throw it out here to see if anyone else has seen this behavior.


Yes, I did restart the watch and attempt it again.


TL;DR:  Watch wouldn't take screenshots below ~10% battery even after reboot. Has anyone else noticed this, or would anyone be game to test it next time your watch battery gets low?

EDIT: It would also be nice if Apple (or someone) supplied some sort of cheat sheet to help us learn what each kind of tap means.

3,Apple Watch Stand Giveaway!,"edit: All Spots are gone! Thanks for the interest. We will definately keep /AppleWatch/ in mind when we have more products ready! All people should be receiving promo codes shortly


Hey everyone! 


We have recently started carrying Apple Watch stands and wanted to generate some buzz and receive some reviews for my product that we have listed on Amazon, and what better way then to do a Giveaway to my brothers in the waiting game /AppleWatch/ !


Our first Apple Watch product is a simple, basic, cost effective stand that gets the job done for a cheap price. It's nothing fancy, but it'll keep your watch off the table and safe from spills. We are currently offering it in white and black. 


The stand will come free of charge! Ok I lied, it will cost you .02 (pun intended) plus the cost of shipping, unless ofcoarse you have prime, at which case it will be delivered free. All we ask is that once you receive the product, simply take a few moments to drop a line or two for a product review. Pretty good deal right?


So if your interested and willing, drop us a PM and we'll get you all set up! 


At this time, We will only be able to accommodate 20 reviewers and we will update this once the spots are all gone. However, you can still contact us to have your name saved for when we receive our next Apple Watch Products ( which should be within the next few weeks) and you will receive priority for a spot.

I can't decide between these two, but am kind of leaning toward the SS due to the versatility of the bands in the long run.


I do a lot of running and circuit training and was curious if those with the SS have any issues with the weight of a watch vs the AWS being lighter and more fitness band-y.


I went ahead and ordered both - and am (im)patiently waiting for them to arrive (Last week of June/First week of July delivery estimate).


Anyone have anything to weigh in to this? Pros/Cons of each (other than the obvious sapphire/SS vs aluminum)

0,Why I Hate My Apple Watch And The Stores Don't Know What To Do,"Tonight, I just made my third Genius Bar appointment for tomorrow morning about me Watch. The first wasn't even an official appointment as I thought my band was falling out only to be told it was just loose and there was nothing to be done. I thought ""ok, whatever, some of my other watches have loose bands"". 
The second was on Saturday about how I was told I have a defective battery by both Apple Support and a few people on here. They told me that I should let the battery run dry and fully charge it twice. I did both cycles THIS MORNING and still was able to charge it to completion to have for a party this afternoon. 
Now, if I'm not told to do something else that won't work by someone who doesn't even have a Watch, I might just return it because three trips to a store to make sure my $700 watch works correctly is ludicrous! Not to mention they couldn't even run any diagnostics on my Watch after an hour of trying. Why should I have to wait another whole month to get this watch to work. The next person to ask me ""how much did you pay?"" or ""was it worth it?"", my answers will be ""too much"" and ""no"" respectively. Sure I could conceivably understand this kind of trouble on the base model, but not on the highest end one the normal person could buy. I might as well use the money I get back to build a decent PC. 


TL;DR $700 watch broken out of the box, Genius Bar doesn't know what's really wrong, two strikes against Apple Watch.

Those two sessions plus whatever miscellaneous activity I do throughout the day is always enough to make my goal. 


I've notice since the 19th (the day I installed 1.01), I haven't reached my goal since. I think it is due to the heart rate sensor not performing as it had in the past. 


I do use the workout app for those walks, so I would assume it monitors more often than when it's not running the app. 


It seems like my workouts which are about the same every day are registering about 10% less calories than before.

If nobody recognizes me I was the guy that had his longboard break and have his watch destroyed (I would insert a link here but I'm on mobile) Anyway repair is out of the equation the watch doesn't even power on and it's quite destroyed. I'm selling things to raise the money for a new watch, among these things I am selling my beloved go pro, which I won after wanting one for ages. (PM if your interested in buying) 


Now your probably wanting to know the purpose of this post, and it's to try to raise funds. (Yes I'm fundraising for an apple watch, I know it's stupid.) If you want to donate a dollar or 100 dollars or 5 cents it's appreciated. (PayPal will be listed at the bottom of this post)


Now you are inclined to donate im just wondering if anyone would be kind enough to donate. Now your probably wondering why this matters so much to me and why should some random guy like me have the audacity to ask for donations? Well I'm about to explain: 


I love apple, everything they make is absolutely amazing and ever since I got my first iPod s friend gave to me I've loved the way everything works. When I heard the rumours that apple was making a watch I was excited, VERY excited. And I started saving before I even knew what the watch looked like. Now up here where I live most places won't hire people under the age of 16 ATLEAST and I've tried to get a job but I've had no luck, so in order to get the money I had to do lawn service all last summer and do chores and back breaking work to raise every tiny little amount of money, and around April 2nd I finally hit my target amount, after almost an entire year of waiting and and entire summer of the most tedious and exhausting labour. Well just like most of you I sat up on April 10th and put my watch order in. I practically had an orgasm when I put my order in. The two weeks after that felt like forever but eventually my watch came. It was such an amazing feeling and the watch was the coolest thing I think I've ever bought. A little less then a month later and ALL my hard work went right down the drain when I had my accident. 


Summary: waited for the watch, worked for the watch, loved the watch, broke the watch. 


So after all that if you want to donate my paypal is:

I also ordered an Brown Leather Loop that arrived last week before my actual watch, so I went to an Apple Store today and I tried on a LL and a Milanese Loop as well. I was pretty underwhelmed with the Leather Loop in person and on my wrist - it just didn't seem like a $150 leather watch strap. I liked the Milanese Loop way more. 


I want to return the Leather Loop and get a Milanese Loop instead. Just the Milanese band has a shipping estimate of 7-8 weeks which is about 2 weeks after my actual AW would arrive. However, if I cancelled my current order and ordered a 42mm SS ML Watch, then it should ship within 4-5 weeks, which is right about when my current order should deliver, so I'd probably get the Watch beginning of July, not end of June.

I didn't extensively review or compare the two but I own an Apple Watch and wore a Microsoft band for a few minutes and I love the apple Watch more. I am a watch guy. I think the Band has some cool features like stand alone GPS and a tiny keyboard that is good at figuring out what your stubby sausage fingers meant to type but it's idea is more similar to a Fitbit instead of a mulifunctional watch. The Band will ""read"" (display) an email one line at a time (you set the speed) but in the quick demo I got I didn't see it as good as reading the email on the 42mm screen. The battery of the Band, I was told, is amazing - unless your using GPS. 


I thought the idea was good but it's execution wasn't as ""pretty"" and easy to use as the Apple Watch. Not to mention ""they"" don't have any third party apps... Or apps at all. 


It's cute but it ain't no Apple Watch. Who has even heard of this thing before ?!

Any of you out there with the black band that have had it for a while that haven't experienced any noticeable wear on it? As in, large portions of the band have started look as if a layer is peeling off. 




for those who've had the white band for a while, have you experienced any wear at all? I've only really heard of the wear happening on the black band.

0,"""Is that the Apple Watch?! What does it do???""","Every. body. asks me this question.  I've thought a lot about it, and now my answer is that it doesn't really DO anything.  If you approach AW like you would a smartphone, you will be very disappointed in its functionality; akin to how people could have been frustrated with the utility of an 1st gen iPad compared to a full PC. But you don't use it like you use your phone or laptop.  You forget you wear it.  It's a passive device, sitting quietly making small but meaningful improvements to your daily activities.  It's very organic; even something as geeky-looking as using Apple Pay just feels very natural, especially compared to iPhone.  It just makes sense. 


Yes, if they really want to know its features, you can explain notifications, fitness, apps, pay, etc.. However, for me, its best feature is that you forget it's even there; it's as a watch should be.

I notice when I use the watch with classic buckle, often it'll make clicking noise. I switch to the sport band, haven't heard the clicking noise when receiving notifications.


At first, I thought it's because I'm wearing it too tight / loose. So I tried wearing it really tight and loose with the SB, seems alright. Tried classic buckle really tight and a bit loose, when it's really  tight. It's just sometimes, however when it's normal to loose, it's often making the clicking noise, and the haptic feedback it's a bit weak.


Anyone else have similar experience with classic buckle?


Edit: Just realised that I'm not making myself really clear, the clicking noise I'm referring to is not when you put the strap back to the watch, rather than when you're using the watch, when the watch is vibrating/tapping you, it makes clicking noise. Especially prominent when sending/receiving a fast heartbeat.",2015-05-31

I’m very interested in getting an apple watch sport, but I’m intending to buy plenty of 22mm watch bands, and use an adapter to make them work with the watch. The only issue is that I’ll likely want to use nice tan leather bands as well as colourful orange sport bands. I’m also likely going to be using some nice NATO bands from Crown and Buckle. I know for a fact that these bands will work with the silver aluminum sport, but I really like the look of the space grey sport. Do you guys think that the space grey is versatile? Will it with with bands from Crown and Buckle, and metal link bands? If you have pictures of the Space grey with colored bands or third party leather bands, please post them here. Also, if I choose to go with the aluminum sport white, how can I use bands to make it look more classy and less gadget-like. Also post photos of your silver aluminum sport looking classy and professional. This will make my choice much easier!

24,Apple Watch success story,"So I had ordered my Apple Watch a few days ago, and yesterday morning I ordered a MacBook Pro and paid extra for overnight shipping so I could get it pre-noon this morning.


Well, I wake up this morning to see the shipping confirmation that says it will be here... Tomorrow morning. I talked to Apple support and they gave me the runaround about how it takes 24hrs, yadda yadda.


I asked if anything could be done and he said to call a number, which I did, and they said they would see what they could do. I figured they would just refund the shipping cost ($22).


Less than an hour later I get a notification that my Apple Watch that was on the 3-5 weeks shipping has now been processed and shipped and is on overnight air to be delivered tomorrow morning with my MacBook Pro.


I'm not sure if someone at Apple decided to be my guardian angel, or if this is some kind of crazy coincidence, but I'm thankful either way! <3",2015-06-03

2,Anyone want a gently used 38 SS BSB right now?,"(Note: the mods have okayed this post!)


So as I posted recently, I lost my job a couple weeks ago and have been coveting the SGS every time I saw pics of it on here, so I finally decided to take the plunge and ""downgrade."" (I am loving the SGS, though! It's what I would have bought if I hadn't thought ""hey the SS looks more 'professional' and I can afford it now with this job!"" Duhr...)


I contacted Apple and while they were very sympathetic, they confirmed that it's too late to do a return. So I will have to sell it, and I thought since there are so many people still waiting for their watches that I'd offer it here. 


The Watch is in perfect condition, no damage, and I just gently polished and cleaned it before putting it back in its plastic wrap and box (and whispering ""Good night, sweet prince."") The band has some very minor signs of wear on the inside only where the pieces contact each other and the matte finish has rubbed off. (Note I wore S/M, the M/L band half is brand new.) It comes in the original box and packaging with the (nicer than the Sport's! Grr!) charger and all documentation. 
Photos
 Honestly, aside from the slight wear on the band, you can not even tell that it is used.


I am hoping to recover as much as I can, but obviously I want to give some discount since it is lightly used. I'm asking $550, or $600 including AppleCare. (I recommend the AppleCare because it will be way easier to get it now than trying to add it to a secondhand watch if you decide you want it. I confirmed with Apple I just give you the original Proof of Purchase and Certificate of Coverage and then email them with all your info changing the owner over.)

7,Classic Buckle,"After hearing for a while that retail Apple Stores were starting to carry standalone watch bands, I decided to give my local store a call to see if they had a 38mm classic buckle band in stock. They did and I picked one up today.  For context, I already have white and pink sports bands and a Milanese Loop.  I have been waiting for standalone modern buckle bands to become available but decided in the meantime to check out the classic buckle again despite reading some negative comments and being a bit lukewarm at my try-on appointment back in April.  Now that it has been on my wrist for hours rather than just one among many bands for a few minutes during a try-on, I really like it.  In my opinion the leather is very attractive and comfortable.  I like that the leather is a flat black with no stitching.  I like the leather grain.  And the buckle is more attractive (and functions better) than any buckle I have ever owned.  At the moment I prefer it to the Milanese Loop and will probably use it as my every day band.  Lesson learned - try-on appointment may be too short to truly assess the different bands.",2015-06-06

Violet
, just finally got its latest update v1.3.0 pushed to the store. My major goal with this update was to fix some loading errors and unresponsiveness, along with some other minor fixes.


I am looking forward to WWDC for an announcement of native apps, along with most of you. I definitely plan on making this app native (should Apple release the capability), and would love to let you all test the app before the official release of native apps through TestFlight. If you would like me to contact you if Apple does allow apps on the beta operating system to be tested, please post here or message me and I'll shoot you a message when I have a native version working.


Here's the changelog for v1.3.0:




Smoother subreddit listings and comments


Handoff links to your iPhone: just drag up from your lock screen!


Reworked layout for changes in Watch OS 1.0.1


Optional hiding of thumbnails


Color coded comments for comment depth


Support for image hosting sites other than imgur


Support for your personal system-wide font size


Other small fixes and improvements




My future goals still include logging in with your reddit account to allow automatic loading of your subscribed subreddits, voting on posts, and commenting.


As always, suggestions are welcome! Most of the changes I make are from suggestions from this wonderful subreddit.

2,Wearing two Apple watches paired to two iPhones... AMA!,"Got my SBSS last week to replace my SGS, decided to wear both for a while. I even went as far as to get a 
T-Mobile 7 day free trial
 to have a second iPhone to pair the other watch with. If anyone has any questions about how two watches works, feel free to ask. Or if you want me to test out anything, let me know too!


Proof... as if someone would actually lie about this


Some observations so far:




I originally put my SGS in airplane mode when I got the SBSS to prevent the SGS from erasing itself after unpairing. I thought that the moment I turned off airplane mode the iPhone would go ahead and delete the SGS, but it turns out it didn't do much of anything.




Right now I have my iMessage signed onto both phones, and somewhat predictably, there is a slight delay in one phone/watch combination getting a message/tap/sketch over another. It seems random, probably based on network and so forth.




I'm right handed, so it seems to make sense the activity app on my right watch seems to pick up more steps, calories burned and exercise minutes than my left one. Also on occasion, one watch or the other would miss that i stood for an hour.




Battery life savings on airplane mode seemed minimal at first, my SGS left in airplane mode drained just a tad slower, which leads me to believe the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth radios are pretty power efficient. Now that I have both paired with iPhones I can see how a month old battery compares to a week old battery.",2015-06-10

0,Can someone with an apple watch test my app?,"Hey guys, 2 days my app ""Drive Protected"" 
https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drive-protected/id996268288?mt=8
 was released, which lets your Apple Watch let you know know when you are going over your set comfortable speed. 


So it works great on the simulator and all but I don't have a watch to test it in real life, so if someone could check it out and let me know, maybe some feedback, thatd be a big help!


You can test the speed as low as 1mph please don't get in your car and drive 80 to see if it works*****

0,Why I'm selling my Apple Watch (SS BSB),"I’ve had the watch for two weeks now, and I think the thing that most impressed me is how much it made me appreciate my Citizen Eco-Drive.


[DISCLAIMER] I did not pay for my Stainless Steel Black Sports Band Apple Watch. My work bought it for me as a “thank you” for some recent projects performed above and beyond. The important thing here is that I had not planned on purchasing the watch, and was instead going to watch the direction Apple took with it.
[/DISCLAIMER]


Pairing with my phone was simple and it does all the wonderful things you can read about and watch videos of. I won’t go into detail about what it does. Instead, I thought I’d explain why I’m going to sell it.


OMFG Alerts! I have a female friend that likes to text or message me. When she gets going, it’ll be rapid fire multiple messages. At that point, I’m beginning to wonder if my watch has turned into a new sex toy. Sure, I like to stay on top of things and I’m a generally connected person as someone who works in IT. In fact, I pride myself on my rapid response to communications, so it seemed the watch would help me catch those missed alerts and mails when the phone is too quiet, or I can’t feel the vibration through my coat.


Instead, what I found was I’d be having a nice conversation with someone, and suddenly my wrist would be begging for my attention. This was something I grew to loathe. Yes, I can place it in silent mode or whatever, but its “one more thing” to remember and one more distraction from actually connecting with people in real life.


But the apps! I’m a runner, and I have a Suunto Ambit 2 that is quite frankly the most badass running, swimming, triathlon, mountaineering, and hiking watch I’ve ever laid my eyes on. The screen is always on and I don’t have to do a magic “flick” of my wrist to see immediate information about pace, distance, and heart rate. All of that is on one huge screen I might add. Which means the Apple Watch is sorely lacking compared to my usual training watch.


What about the other apps? What about em, I say. They’ve 1/10th the functionality of the phone version which usually means I have to grab my phone anyway, so the watch really delays the inevitable for me.


I’m not here to hate on the Apple Watch, I think its a fine device and will certainly work for people other than me. Working in IT for the past 15 years, and growing up with computers, I’d have to say I’m a bit burned out on gadgets. Electronic gadgets promise so much, and every year on the new refresh cycle we’re left wanting more and lusting after the later version. This is a rant for another day, however.


Does this soft core rant make me a hipster? Gawd, I hope not. I don’t roll my pant legs up and I still wonder what the fuck is up with those ankle height boots; but I digress.


Suffice it to say, I wasn’t sure the Apple Watch was for me, and I’m lucky to have had the opportunity to really find out first hand.


Where’s the best place to sell this thing anyway? I fucking hate eBay and Paypal, thought the alternatives seem to have higher risk.


Commence down voting :)


FYI - I’ve been a OS X user since 2002 when Apple switched to Intel Procs and released OS X, a POSIX UNIX - which was a BFD at the time. My attitude is pretty agnostic as far as systems and os’s go, not fanboy and not a hater of any of them.",2015-06-13

0,DAE experience random reboots?,"So after a few weeks now, I've run into this problem.


Randomly, I'll be going about my business and feel my Apple watch vibrate, and when I raise my wrist to check what notification I got instead I see the Apple logo, and that my 42 mm SGS has rebooted itself for no reason. 


The first time it happened it resolved itself quickly and I ignored it. A few days later it happened again, resolved itself, and then occurred again every 15 minutes or so. At that point I unpaired my watch from my iPhone 6 and re-paired it. This seemed to fix it.


Now, a week later it randomly rebooted again while I was in line at the movie theater. This time though, it got stuck in a loop of rebooting. I tried hard resetting it by holding both buttons but it was unresponsive. Finally I just tried holding down the button (not the crown) and after a few seconds the display jumped from the Apple logo to the watch face. It seemed to be catching up? So far it's been stable.


Has anyone else had this happen? What causes it? Do I just have a defective Apple watch?",2015-06-13

0,Are you guys sure they actually tested this thing?,"Sorry to be a downer, but I'm a developer and just got my watch earlier this week. I wear real watches and my pet peeve is definitely that I can't just glance at my watch to see what time it is, but I still expected a LOT more polish from Apple. 


For the record, it's paired with a 6 plus. 


It's almost as if the QA guys didn't actually USE one!




go into watch settings and adjust calendar settings. Notice the calendar settings don't update with your changes until you back out and reenter?  I wonder if they would accept an app I submitted with such obvious bugs?




my wrist generates a haptic response at least ten times a day to catch my attention. So I lift the watch, wait for it to notice, and... It shows me the time!!  Uhhh. Why TF did you beep AND buzz??  It's friggin 9:26!!  




calendar glances. I have six appointments tomorrow. If I pull up calendar glances, it tells me I need to take out the trash on Monday. Really?  What about taking the kid to gymnastics?  What about Hailey's birthday party?  Dinner with my parents on Saturday??  No... Skip those calendar events... Just be sure to take out the trash!!  Hailey probably has lice anyway. 




Lots of the third party apps just don't work. Wanderlist is a blank screen. Wunderground works, but before the app starts, the screen turns off.  I thought there was an approval process?






4.1) this problem is not limited to third party apps. Open weather and the screen turns off before it loads. Wake it back up and you go to the home screen. Start weather again and it loads, but turns off within less than a second of actually showing the weather. Flick my wrist again and weather is spinning again, like it's loading for the first time and ... Screen turns off!!  Thanks!!!  I guess I'll just look out the window...




I have apple pay set up. But if I open passbook, it says I have nothing set up. I get notifications of payments no problem, but passbook says nothing is set up. I use my phone to pay (though I have a separate rant about that crap..)




stopwatch. I use a stopwatch while cooking to see how long things are on the pan/grill/etc. this should be AWESOME right?  Wtf?  Did anyone try using this?  Analog lets you time and lap, but only if you swipe up no cumulative time. Digital, again, no cumulative time. Graph, doesn't display ANY lap times, just draws them on a graph. Hybrid had the most hope but the least actual functionality. No lap times at all and definitely no cumulative times.  Thank goodness my oven has a timer function!




is the day of week such a secret, of does apple have trouble figuring it out?  I dunno, call me crazy, but my schedule is heavily driven by the day of week because I have a child. Because I have a child, I am also completely lobotomized most of the time. Is it SOOO hard to just tell me the day of the friggin week so I know if today is gymnastics or dance without trying to remember what TF I did yesterday?!?!?  None of the regular analog watch faces offer this information. They can out my initials in the middle of the watch - I have yet to come up with a use for that - but the day of week?  NOOOOO!




messages. Ok, so, my friend sent me some inappropriate messages (him looking at porn on his apple watch.) I delete that stuff from my phone, cause... It's inappropriate. So someone else texts me and my daughter starts checking out my watch and Lo-and-behold!!!  Those messages are STILL ON MY WATCH!!  What's more, I can't delete a particular inappropriate message!!  I can only delete the entire conversation!!




DND. This thing has a haptic thing, right. Well, my phone goes DND after 7pm so I do t get weird texts that wake up my kids and annoy the wife. But I could at least get a buzz notification of a text on my watch. Nope. Can't do that. It's either full beep, buzz, display or nothing. I'm guessing apple decision makers probably don't have families. 




photos. Okay folks, this is where I am SURE nobody at apple actually tried using it. When you open photos, what would you typically want to see, the most recent pictures, or the one halfway between now and the time you bought your phone??  If you said the latter, you are I luck!!  If you want to see the most recent pictures, you should look for another device. It's a three finger operation and you really have to be commuted to the cause!!  Even when you can get close, it'll take some perseverance to get to the most recent one!






Okay.  I'm done. Overall, it's actually growing on me just for the notifications.  Though I still think it's too small. Oh, and the screen timeout!!  Dear God, what is it 2 seconds or something???  Couldn't make that configurable, could ya??  


The worst is when I raise my wrist to see the time... The time does not show up.  I give up and wiggle the wrist. Still no time. What time is it??  As I lower my wrist, I see the screen turn on... So I raise it again and IT TURNS OFF!!!  WTF!!!  What time is it already?!?!?!  I'll just look at my phone....",2015-06-13

7,Finally Tamed the Exercise Ring!,"TL;DR After reading a bunch of posts, I put it in Other for my evening run.  Every minute of running counted. 


I'm not a fast runner.  My dog knocked me down last fall and hurt my hip, and it still hurts.  So I'm in the 16-19 minute mile range, counting stopping for dog pee breaks, dog swimming breaks, water breaks, etc.  I don't pause for that.  My HR varies from 100-150, depending on if I'm running leisurely or sprinting.  But I run a mile and a half every morning before work, and 3-5 miles after work, and on weekends I get in a medium run, and a long run of up to 13 miles.  So- it was annoying me that I wasn't getting credit for that.


I use Map My Walk as my primary running app, I think because it has such a wide variety of types of runs/walks compared to MMR.  I like the maps (which I use for reference- I only do trail running) and the summary after the run.  I think I'm going to take a look at Strava, though.  


Edit:  my true caloric burn will still be calculated by my heart rate- so I don't consider this ""cheating.""  The Move ring has always filled up easily for  me.  


Edit 2:  Okay, I thought about this today.  So, just for the sake of argument, let's say I'm cheating myself by filling my Exercise ring too easily, using Other.  How does AW calculate my caloric burn?  It knows my height and weight, but then does it use HR?  I think yes, because doesn't it warn you that caloric burn calculation will not be as accurate if you disable it during exercise tracking?  But, even if it's steps, accelerometer, GPS (via the phone) or a combination, the end result is I'm burning more calories that AW told me to.  So how does it reward me?  It ups my calorie (Move) goal!",2015-06-14

44,Almost one month with my Apple Watch Sport. My review. And ~~some~~ a lot of background.,"So, I set my alarm on 4/10 at 0400 EST, to be first in line for the new watch. I was amped.


Some background, I have worn a stainless steel Arctura Seiko Kinetic,with a stainless steel band since 1996. I also have a 1958 Omega SeaMaster ""With Sea Monster"" (my dads) and my Grandfather's 1953 Hamilton 18k gold ""retirement watch. I have always loved watches! 


Then I heard about the Apple Watch. I was intrigued. When the showed the models I was stunned. The Space Black Stainless with Link Bracelet was exactly what I wanted as it was stylishly close to the Arctura.


Then they release pricing for that watch,,,ugh. I couldn't justify spending upwards of $1100 USD for a first generation apple watch. 


So I decided at that point the Sport with the Space Gray would be the way to go. 


Back to 4/10, If you haven't figured it out, I hosed the launch time offset for PST-EST. So I am an hour late for the ordering of what turns out to be the most popular version of the Apple Watch Sport.


I get a ""June"" ship date. jeezus. I begin the 
daily
 hourly scrubbing of the /r/applewatch sub. 


I study order times, shipping windows,production yields, sales projections. In short the obsession was unstoppable. My poor GF had heard enough.


After two weeks it goes to ""May 29- June 11th"". Then I hooked into the /r/applewatchshipping  sub. Then the movements starts to happen. I see second wave orders going out early. I see reports from supplies that the supply chain is ""up stop speed"". I start researching how many watches fit on the planes from China. 


For verification of the above, check my post history. It is certainly obsessive.


I received my watch three days ahead of the stated shipping window.


Build/Quality Impressions




Build quality is top notch. Typical Apple construction. Have had no quality issues with band or watch. Awesome work!




I have a Spigen Crystal Screen protector on it. It is damn near invisible but provides me with a little comfort regarding the Ion-X glass. Getting it placed correctly is a beast though.




The face is always bright and clear and always awakes when I look at it. I know some people have issues with this. I have not.




I also have a Spigen Crystal case. I only use this at the gym. The knurled weight bars scare me around the black aluminum. The watch design is too slick to wear the case all the time. IMO. I do recommend this case as it is unobtrusive and provides some good protection against ""bumps and brushes"".




The black fluoroelastomer band does ""stretch"" some. When I first started. I was a 4th hole from the end of the M/L end for a comfort fit and a 3rd hole for ""tight"" fit. That has changed to a 3rd hole for comfort and the 2nd hole for ""tight"". The finish on the band has remained unchanged with a little warm water and the microfiber cloth cleaning.




Battery life has been acceptable. I get up around 0545 and asleep by 2315 and usually end the day with 20% battery remaining. I have fell asleep with it on (Damnit June 3rd) and woke up with 18% in the morning and by charging while I showered and dressed still made it through the next day. This includes about an hour of ""Activity/HR"" tracking daily. 




I do not have a charging stand. Do not see the need. It charges fine on the nightstand. YMMV.






Applications/UI Impressions




The pairing process was painless and simple.If you are in a hurry to get started sync the Apple Watch compatible apps later instead of during set-up. that way you can tailor watch alerts that come to the watch easier and control what is loaded onto the watch.




Spend some time tweaking your phone notifications. I have just gotten this down. I do not need the phone to vibrate for every alert when on silent. Let the haptic alert you on the watch. Took some tweaking but I think the key is to suppress the vibrate on the phone when the phone is set to silent. That way you just get the haptic on the watch and not the jump from your pocket.




I have had no issues with alerts/notifications.




Native Apple Apps are nice. The ""Activity"" app stands out! More on that later.




Apple app ""Camera""  is great, the framing and timing are great. 




Calendar works, It is nice knowing what meeting is next.




Maps and turn by turn is nice for walking, but the haptic seems to be ""weak"" for motorcycle and car driving.




Phone. The call quality is acceptable for the size of the speaker. It is nice for when you are wandering around at home and the phone is not on you. Would not recommend for auto or public use.




Siri is so much better on the watch. The dictation accuracy is much better.




Apple Pay. Awesome. Nuff' said.




Faces. Customization is nice. Cant wait for third party faces and complications. Standout faces are Chronograph and Simple. YMMV.




Mail. Notifications are great. The haphazard way that some messages can be read on the watch and other push you to the phone can be frustrating. But I just use this to see the subject and sender. If I need to read the message and/or reply I need the phone.




Text messaging - the contextual text message replies work great, A friend asked to meet at 6:30 or 7:00 and the first two options were""6:30"" or ""7:00"". perfect, and voice recognition for dictation is much better.




The heartbeat and drawing app to send to another watch seems fun, I just don't have enough friemd with the apple watch to  make the most of it.






Non-Native Apps

Not a lot of greatness here, a couple apps stand out. IMO. This should improve drastically in watchOS 2.0.




MacID - having my Mac and Mac Book lock and unlock based upon proximity is damn near genius.




Wunderground - WeatherUndergound. After the interminable app loading time, having real time radar is nice. Did I mention the wait for it to load. It is not fast.




MyPlate app. Works well with Activity tracking and calorie tracking to give you a running count of calories needed to consume.






Standout App

Activity App is the best. The caloric tracking matches the gym on elliptical and treadmill.  Motivated me every day to get off my ass and move. The key for the activity ring is to walk at a pace greater than an 18 minute mile. That will fill it up every time.


I have my goals set as follows,


12 hours standing - which I think is unchangeable.


30 minutes of exercise - which is my daily minimum.


700 calories worth of the ""Move"" ring. I upped this to 700 calories after the intial week of 650 calories.


The key here is to do a couple of running workouts and walking workouts outside with the phone to allow it to calibrate you stride length.


My motivation to fill those circles is disturbing but satisfying,

https://imgur.com/gallery/lGZNT/new


Stuff I haven't used or found useful




Pictures - on a 42mm screen?? really?




Battery Complication - use it as a glance, no need to be camping on it. The watch will last the day.






Overall TL/DR

A great watch and activity tracker. As native applications become available it will only get better. Highly recommend.


Maybe the next version I will spring for the Space Black Link.

Did I skip a step during setup or something, like this is a $429 Bluetooth accessory. I've seen watches for $30 on Amazon that can do half the stuff this thing does.

2,"After one week with watchOS 2, here's my take","I'm a part-time coder, but not the kind that had a budget for a development watch and a production watch. So last week my only watch got watchOS 2 treatment, for better or worse.


I'm mostly posting this to assuage the fears of those of you resisting the call of the beta. This is what you're missing out on.


The good




I like the new photo and time-lapse watch faces - no complications but perfect for a weekend or winding down.




The bad




I used to have 55%+ battery left at the end of every day. Now I regularly get 10% battery warning in the evening.




The last time I sensed haptic feedback was a week ago. I'm not kidding. Even when force touching on watch faces to change them up I get nothing. Needless to say, I'm bummed about that.




The last time I completed all three of my Activities rings was a week ago. I haven't changed my routine at all but I come up short, especially on Move ring. I suspect the tracker requires more fine tuning.




The watch is very slow and glitchy, and often Notifications panel is just blank despite a red dot showing pending notifications.






Anyway, I'm looking forward to watchOS 2 beta evolution but if you don't have it yet consider it a blessing.

Now, having used it every day, I don't see any features that make it impressive, make it worth more $100 (It's a more reliable pebble, which was the absolute minimum I expected since it's an in-house apple product).


I google AppleWatch features, and get crap apps (despite what bloggers think, I don't need 5 weather apps or Shazam!).  The third party apps do not seem to have developed yet.  When I heard about the AppleWatch initially, I envisioned a game changing device to plunge me into some high tech, cyberpunk world.  I just got a watch that receives notifications.  Period.  I use it for almost nothing else.


Right now I tell everyone that, while I don't regret buying it (the wondering would have killed me), I recommend it to no one; it serves no purpose (not a purpose worth $500).

6,"""Workaround"" for accurate calorie tracking","Since the current method the Apple Watch uses to track resting calories seems off (in my case, my watch says my ""resting"" burn is 2570 calories every day, but I calculate my actual base metabolic rate [BMR] at 1810), I've found an alternate method of tracking caloric burn (for the purposes of weight management) that, based on a few weeks of data, seems to be much more accurate than whatever the heck it is that the Activity app shows.


It requires that you use the Apple Watch in conjunction with MyFitnessPal.


Setup:




In MyFitnessPal, use the ""Steps"" page on the More... screen to specify your Watch and Phone as your source of step data




Calculate your BMR (use a site like this one: 
http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/
 )




In MyFitnessPal, use the ""Goals"" page on the More... screen to set ""Calories"" (under Nutrition Goals) to your calculated BMR value




Also on the ""Goals"" screen, make sure your current and goal weight are entered.




In the Health app, go to Sources, select MyFitnessPal, and make sure that app is set up to read Weight, Steps, and Workout data.






Method:


Track your food intake in MyFitnessPal as you normally would. 


Let MyFitnessPal automatically read your steps and workout data from the Watch and Activity apps.


MyFitnessPal will combine your activity level with your BMR value and give you a surprisingly accurate daily, goal-based target for your caloric intake (the calories ""Remaining"" value on the main screen)


Using this method, MyFitnessPal gives me daily targets that 
precisely
 match my calculated Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) values. The ""daily burn"" listed in the Activity app remains way too high, meanwhile, and I am now ignoring it altogether. I just focus on meeting my daily move target, and let MyFitnessPal keep me on track with my diet.


It works for me -- would love to hear if anyone else can replicate my success!


EDIT -- TL;DR:


The Activity app's ""resting calories"" value is too high, and you can't override the value Apple chooses for you. MyFitnessPal (and apps like it) let you pull the ""active calories"" data (which is accurate) from your Watch and add it to a ""resting""/BMR value that you can set. Ideally this value is based on the scientifically-sound, well-supported Harris-Benedict formula for BMR.


The fix for Apple would be for them to correct their ""resting"" value OR let you override it with a value you calculate yourself.",2015-06-18

0,Battery life is no good...,"click bait - it's GREAT!


My first full day with the watch was yesterday.  Slapped it on at 6:15am EST with 100% battery.  Used it a bunch throughout the day.  Being my first day, I showed numerous people at work the functionality of the watch, used it to check stats, weather, HR (every 10 min), activity monitor, etc.  I even took a few calls on it when my hands were full.  Finished my day at work, then went to tutor.  Once again showed a couple people some of the functionality and used it for notifications since I wasn't able to check my phone.  Went to dinner with some family members, showed it off and then went and hung out at a friends.  When I got home (around 10:30pm), it was storming, had no power and my phone was at 9% (Watch was at about 35%).  Obviously couldn't use my phone as an alarm, as it would die.  So I set the watch with an alarm.


Watch alarm woke me up at 6:15am, with 15% battery still remaining.  Put it on the charger, got ready for work (~45 min) and then took it off and it had about 80% charge.

One thing I considered when buying it was now that I have access to something on my wrist, will I use a lot more data? I kind of accepted the fact that I would, as with my phone I typically use about 2GB a month, now I am adding this watch with it as well? yeah that will be another GB a month.


Well nearly a week in, and my data usage has dropped considerably. What I didn't take into account was, for instance, a weather app, there is a lot of data that it is loading when opening, that I will never look at. With the watch, it is loading only what I need to see. I have found my phone use has dropped by half, and the last week I haven't used over 35MB a day (16MB if you don't count a day when I went down town and used navi, yelp, etc)

Even if I tap the screen, it'll just sit there for a while--even though it already picked up what I said. Half the time, it won't even go through.


It's been getting so bad, that I don't see much of a use for having the Watch anymore! I've turned both my Watch and Phone off several times to try and fix the problem--get it back to the way it was when I first got it. Is there anything else I can do?",2015-06-19

0,Extremely bad experience in pre-ordering X-Doria Defense Edge for Apple Watch,"I want to share with you guys on my experience in pre-ordering X-Doria Defence Edge for Apple Watch. 
Their customer service really pissed me off by cheating me from time to time and eventually THEY canceled my order and refunded to me at last minute, but having other customer’s order being fulfilled. I hope this disclosure of the details of email communication can act as an alert to you in ordering from them.


I pre-ordered on 10 April for the Gold Color option but changed my mind to silver after 2 days. I got confirmation from the customer service representative Kim Brown that she would take care of my pre-order.


On 27 April, I checked my order on their website and it said my order had been fulfilled but I did not receive any tracking numbers for the shipment. So I emailed Kim again to clarify.


On 28 April, she replied me that due to a manufacturing delay, this product would not ship until late May or early June. I could change, cancel my order to accept a 20% refund of the cost if I could wait. I chose to enjoy the 20% off and I received the refund a couple of days later.


At late May, I still haven’t received any news on it. Until 31 May, I received an email from Kim on an update on shipping schedule for Defence Edge and it was claimed that I would receive tracking # as my order ships. So here’s the email:


>In our last communication, we promised a shipping date for all orders in May. Orders for Defense Edge have finally left our factory but unfortunately, we are going to fall short of our promised ship dates once more.


>To give some explanation, Defense Edge is made by a complicated process where we first mill a block of aluminum, anodize it and then inject soft plastic around the interior surface.  As we entered mass production, our initial results were not meeting our high standards.  Production has since stabilized and we are able to give more precise ship windows for your orders.


>Apple Watch 42 mm 
>Silver - Silver units of Defense Edge have landed in Los Angeles and are in the process of transferring to our fulfillment warehouse for shipping.  Shipping Window - June 1 - 5
>Gold - Shipping Window - June 22 - 26


>Apple Watch 38 mm
>Silver - Shipping Window - June 15 - 19
>Gold - Shipping Window - - June 22 - 26


>Again, we deeply apologise for the delays in fulfilling your order.  Please know that if you have changed your mind about purchasing Defence Edge, you can reply to this email and we will quickly refund your money.


>We appreciate your interest and business.  We are working to get Defence Edge into your hands as soon as possible.


So I acknowledged the email by replying and hoped they could ship as scheduled.


On 19 June, I still haven’t received my tracking number so I emailed them again. And here is the email that pissed me off that they couldn’t even give a valid reason on canceling my order at their side, while they said the shipped to some other customers indeed. This is completely a discrimination, unfair and unprofessional, as they should say to themselves instead!


>A few weeks ago, 
we began shipping our Defense Edge in silver for the 48 mm Apple Watch.  While our production continues, yet again, we are unable to maintain our latest schedule to you.


>At this point, it would be extremely unfair and unprofessional to hold your money or to make further schedule commitments as those commitments would not be credible.


>So today, we are refunding your money. Defense Edge in multiple colors will continue to launch this summer but the timing is unknown.  When the remaining models of Defense Edge are safely in our warehouse, ready to ship, we will make it available for purchase.


>As our apology, here is a discount code for 50% off anything in our store.  You can use this code for a future purchase of Defense Edge or anything else you like.


>Again, we apologize for the delay.**

68,Apple/Ive surprises me again!,"Read this in a forum, they should mention this in keynotes..


""6000 Series Aluminum. Likely an alloy 6061-T6. Commonly known as ""Aircraft grade"" aluminum. Which I've always found funny, because the aerospace industry uses 5052-H32 alloy just as much. 


Anyway, 7000 series is a step up and fairly uncommon. 5052 alloys are the most common in my experience working in sheetmetal, and 6000 alloys are used sparingly for certain circumstances. 7000 series is used in only very specific circumstances. 5000 and 6000 alloys are seen as strong/light enough for most applications. 


You know the flight recorder ""black boxes?"" They're made from 5052-H32. And those things are designed to withstand a plane crash. So 7000 is used in only extreme cases of strength/weight optimizations. 


Btw, 7000 is very hard to machine due to being so much harder than 6000. So for those of you complaining that $350 is expensive, I'm frankly STUNNED that Apple is producing a mass market product intricately machined out of a 7000 alloy and only charging $350. That is simply unbelievable, a true display of their design and manufacturing excellence.""

8,The Future: Some thoughts about the Apple Watch and smart watches in general,"I'm a big tech guy and have watched and worn several smart watches over the last few years. My favorite (pre-AW) was the a Pebble and I have high hopes for the next Moto 360.


What I think Apple nails is what I feel is the obvious future. Stick with me, this gets a little fuzzy.


Let's look at the iPad and other tablets. There are entire consumer bases where a tablet is just the right amount of computer for them. It sends email, writes docs, browses the web, and displays pictures. With the ever-expanding App Store, it's becoming more and more reasonable to get an iPad over a traditional notebook.


Like tablets, I think the Apple Watch will expose a whole new consumer base where a smart watch is just the right amount of communication device. And like the iPad, it's going to really blow up as developers are able to expand its feature set.


Right off the bat, I immediately think of all the friends I have that barely ever leave the lock screen, quickly handling notifications as they come in (reply to text, archive email, favorite a tweet, play back voicemail, etc).


So what's Apple's game here and why are they so damned smart?


Apple entered this market because they have one thing that Pebble, Google, and Microsoft don't: brilliant third-party developers able to make a living from their platform, contributing to a healthy and fruitful community. Think of all the things that are now part of the OS thanks to third-party apps becoming so popular.


Apple knows that their first outing just has to 
exist
 so developers can get to work on making the Apple Watch and early adapter consumers can help refine the use cases. We're not guinea pigs, though. We're just joining this adventure early :)


I predict that the ""finish line"" for smart watches is a standalone device, with its own SIM card and data plan, with innovative low power antennas, and better ways to keep the thing powered.


[UPDATE: Some clarification based on comments]


A lot of people keep bringing up that they doubt a Watch could replace their computer. It's 
not about replacing your computer
, it's about understanding that each device has a different skill set and that there's a category of user out there that the Watch (likely with WatchOS 3.0) will fulfill all of their needs with the added bonus of being able to do things quickly and right from their wrist. It's seeing the entire market potential, not just your set of use cases.",2015-06-21

16,Yet another Ripley's believe it or not; WaterProof.,"So I decided, knowing that it is under Applecare to really, really push my watch. To see what it can do. I have seen all the videos, and it seems to be common knowledge that the watch can hold up to water a little better then some would think. But my dealings with it have been drop down impressive. I have the steel with the white sport band. 


So, I am in Spain right now. I am Studying abroad. I have had my watch with me 24/7. It had been kinda neat seeing how much I've been walking. Getting directions on the watch, etc. 


Over the past month I have taken the thing into the ocean three times. One time we were kayaking around southern Portugal. Water splashing everywhere.  I did go swimming with it in the ocean. I did submerge it a fair amount. 


Secondly, I did take it into a bath house. This was before the 2nd beach trip. I did go into all three temperatures of baths, the salt bath, the jacuzzi and the steam room with the watch.


With all of this though, the watch is fine. Everything works. It still looks pretty, it still makes sound, it still responds to my touch.


The TLDR Is I know what Apple advertises, but it really does seem you don't have to baby this watch at all. It has been designed really, really well.

like, if the third-party bands looked as nice as the watch-band on a decent non-apple watch, then it might work, but none of them really look like they could stack up against the apple bands or actual quality-made bands. the leather ones are especially awful with the stitching and stuff.

3,Alternatives to Apple leather watch bands - Shell Cordovan.,"If you want to avoid the wall of text here are the 
pictures
 of my shell strap


Over the past few weeks there have been several band replacements and modifications shown on this sub.  Some of them have been nice, and some of them have been questionable.


For a lot of people a watch is a new addition to their lifestyle, and wardrobe.  This is new territory for a lot of people and they will make mistakes and learn as they go.


Apple has provided a wide range of band types which cover most of the general band styles out there with the exception of a nato band, but that will never work as it would cover the rear sensors.  The design of these bands has been fantastic and suit the watch very well.  Apple has always had a great eye for aesthetics and the watch bands are no exception.  


Unfortunately the area where they fall flat is the materials they use in the leather straps.  It is dry, and isn’t going to look good for long (several years).  Provided the watch bands are interchangeable with future models, the leather strap you buy today will be lucky to make it a couple of years before it begins to crack, or worse smell.


Luckily third party adapters for standard bands are easy to find, or alternatively you can use your classic buckle to add a new strap of your choosing.


In my case i elected to go with an unlined shell cordovan strap from Fluco.  They use shell from the horween tannery in Chicago which with a handful of other tanneries world wide are the only producers of Shell cordovan.  The only issue i had with my band was that the stitching was a bit crooked , but it happens.


In case you are curious Shell is sources from the rear of a horse and isn’t skin like other leathers.  It is actually the fibrous flat muscle.  Shell is fantastic as it doesn’t normally crease(it rolls) and it also doesn’t absorb water/sweat like calf or steer does.  If you are put off by the fact that it is sourced from Mr Ed blame/thank Belgians, French, Quebecers, and even beef producers in Europe as they use horse as a staple meat.


So why choose shell?  The tanning process packs it with oils and greases which ensure it will stay supple for decades, it looks amazing after it begins to patina, it won’t crack(provided you take basic care of it), and it won’t absorb sweat like calf does.


TLDR - Apple leather is horrible, but their designs are great.  If you want a far superior band buy shell cordovan.",2015-06-22

The default app is quite awful as far as display options. There are 3 fields. Top field displays current time or elapsed time. Middle field ONLY displays elapsed time (why even allow top field to display the same elapsed time?). Bottom field displays HR, Calories, or elapsed time. Again... elapsed time can be displayed in three fields...


There's seemingly 
no ability to change the fields from the above (or add fields)

There are no laps or lap times (e.g., for rest intervals).
 


You can't edit a workout.
 (e.g., sometimes I forget to turn off the workout timer and remember a few minutes later. I'd rather save the workout at 1:00 hour rather than the 1:05 including the 5 minutes of idle activity)


Worst of all, there's 
no option to keep the display on the entire workout
. (I don't care about the expense to the battery.) I often have to wait longer to get a new HR measurement than the display shut off time.


Clearly, the default app was not created by someone who has ever stepped foot in a gym.

this video

Third, do all notifications from your phone make it to the watch, regardless of if they are watch apps?


Fourth, do all of my Siri configurations carry over? Such as family relationships, locations, nicknames?


Fifth, what are some simple ways to keep the watch out of harm in day-to-day life, besides just being generally careful?


And finally, how much iPhone battery does it consume on average? I have a ~2 year old 5s, and its battery is a bit on the rough side to begin with. Does the watch use a lot of it?

I feel bad if I don't complete my rings and I try my damnedest to do something to at least hit the minimum goals.


My only issue is that the digital crown now seems to be a little sticky when I turn it. Once it gets moving, it's fine, but I need to put a little effort into getting it going, whereas initially, it would be smooth at all times.

I was hoping someone with some experience or knowledge might be able to shine some light on this.

According to 
this
 it's better for lithium-ion batteries to top them up than wait until they're almost discharged.


Can Apple do a charge cycle count of batteries? If they can, do you think I'd void my AppleCare+ battery warranty if I top-up charge it maybe 10 times each week to try to keep the battery in good nick?

I used maybe 5 minutes on my phone responding to a few messages on fb messenger until 7pm. I checked the battery again and was at 91 percent! Not bad for a 9 hour shift and usually texting on the iPhone leads me to doing other things on the phone killing the battery even more. 


I probably used my Apple watch for about a total of 25-40 minutes today checking the time, using a few apps and replying to texts through dictation and voice recordings. I usually end the day with 50 to 66 percent of battery life on the watch, and I'm hoping native apps won't significantly decrease the battery even more on the watch.",2015-07-09

3,[Update] SGS sport band repairs messed up... Emailed Tim,"So this stupid saga continues from 
here
.  


After about 12 days with my 2nd replacement black sport band with space grey pin, it started to wear smooth. It lost the velvety soft feel and looked and felt like shiny plastic rubber. More peeling and flaking especially near the lugs and the pin holes even though I only use one hole. I was already frustrated and disappointed by now since I was on my 3rd band.  


So I called AppleCare again and talked with a senior advisor for about 40 minutes while he took down all the details and listened to my story. He had never heard of this issue at all so he wanted all the details from my previous bands and the interactions at the store I went to for the swaps. He saw the notes from the Geniuses and the dismissive tone as the previous two swaps were actually filed as CS codes (customer service exceptions, not valid warranty repairs). I expressed my displeasure and he recommended that he directly ship me a replacement black sport band with space grey pin to avoid an upsetting Genius Bar appointment and also to possibly get a part from a different stock.  I agreed reluctantly as this would be my 4th band...  


One day later I get the UPS delivery alert and after a grueling day at work I arrive home to see the brown padded envelope from Apple waiting on my doorstep. After taking it inside and carefully unpacking it (since I need to peel off the label and return my band in the same envelope), I find the nondescript long white box labeled ""42mm"". I unzip the little white pull tab and slide the box out and what do I find?  A black classic leather buckle.  


AppleCare sent me the 
wrong fucking band
.  It's a gorgeous one though. Bright polished stainless steel lugs and buckle and nicely grained leather. I don't feel like it would match with my SGS at all though, and one of the main reasons I picked that model was for the stealthy all matte black look.  


At this point I'm exhausted and beyond annoyed and pissed. I repack the leather buckle and without hesitation I compose a polite but direct email to Mr. Tim Cook. It's been a 2 month runaround with nobody taking responsibility for this issue and my satisfaction.  


For anyone thinking that I'm nuts or a perfectionist or whatever for complaining about a $50 sport band, try to understand my perspective. It's not a one off incident, check the numerous other posts on this sub. It's only happening to the black sport band with space grey pin as far as I know. I feel like it's wearing out far too quickly for 2 weeks of office use. When it's wearing out it looks like a cheap knockoff band that I got for $5 on the street. It doesn't feel like it's something Apple worked hard at designing and making for a brand new product. It doesn't look or feel like Apple.  


So we'll see if I get a reply from anyone today or this week even. I'm also waiting on a reply from the senior AppleCare advisor to OK me shipping the black classic buckle back immediately.",2015-07-09

2,Leather Loopers: Which way do you wear it?,"I picked up a blue Leather Loop this week to go with my SGS, and I'm very happy with both the color and the fit. Since the strap comes in two parts, I've been experimenting with wearing it short-side up and short-side down.


Short-side up
:




Feels best when resting arm on desk/table.


Keeps mismatched stainless steel grommet on outside of arm, out of your sight (though if you have a SS watch, this isn't as much of an eyesore.)


Harder to fasten one-handed; you have to reach over your arm, pull the strap away from you, then back around the wrist.




Short-side down:




Feels a little awkward when resting arm on desk/table, but could get used to it.


Keeps stainless grommet on inside of arm, so only you see the mismatched color.


Much easier to fasten one-handed.




I realize this is totally subjective, but I'm curious if any other leather loop owners have experimented with this and have feelings on the topic.",2015-07-09

I charge it full 100% on day 1 in the morning about 7am-8am to go out and use all day just check time, notification alarm (esp.

Turn it off in the evening about 5pm-6pm when I come home to turn it on again about 7am-8am next day. I use it like this on day 2 - day3 without recharge.

Is there any way to manually add activities such that they show up on the activity rings? I've tried adding them through the Health app, but even those don't sync with the Activity app. Considering that they're both Apple native apps, you'd imagine this is a case they would have considered?


I'm enjoying the watch and I have a week left before I have to decide whether or not to return it..... But this is going to be a deal breaker for me if it can't accurately track my workouts.

0,Apple Watch not registering hourly standing stats...sometimes,"Hello! 


I purchased my SGS Apple Watch two weeks ago and have been amazed since day one, it does all I wanted and more. Except, one thing. 


I'm making an effort to be healthier and get in better shape before my wedding and knew the Apple Watch would play a role in this process. Standing is a huge part of that, I know and I want to have 'complete' days as much as possible. 


I would say about 50% of the time, the watch does not register that I've been standing. I will get the alert to stand, click 'ok' and immediately stand up, walk around the house and do some cleaning or grab some water and will be up for 2-3 minutes but alas, it does not register. 


Is there something I am doing wrong here? Will it always give me the notification that ""I did it"" and can sit back down? I rarely get that, if so. 


Everything else registers perfectly, working out and steps but the stand just isn't getting filled despite the fact that I know I am meeting the goals! 


I googled it and searched the sub and some people stated they had similar issues but I didn't see any results. How does the watch know you're standing? I know it's farfetched but I have very long arms that lay below my waist, could the watch think I am still sitting because it is not as high up? 


Thanks for any help you can provide. 


Edit: Just in case anyone else has this issue and searches for it. I spent the day moving around when my alert went off, moving my arms around, doing some stretches, being silly and moving them up and down (as if I was doing curls with a weight) and wouldn't you know it registered each time! I met my goal with ease today and was very pleased!",2015-07-12
