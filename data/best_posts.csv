"[experiment] Fenix 5 Optical hR vs fenix 3 with HR strap (Squash) Hey r/,I just upgraded to the Fenix 5 Sapphire (Japan edition) after owning a Fenix 3 Sapphire (US edition) for more than a year and a half.I know my F3 was more than enough for my fitness tracking (mostly weightlifting/trail running/hiking/road running/cycling/squash) needs, but I just couldn't stop fantasizing about the F5 with the better battery life, smaller size, crispier screen, better GUI, and most of all, the optical HR sensor.I love my HR data, so I knew that I would still be using the HR strap on my F5 for my activities, but I wanted to test out the accuracy of the optical HR vs the HR strap with different activities.And I'm sad to say, I'm pretty disappointed.I know that the optical HR sensor has its limits and is not accurate for most activities especially things like weightlifting, but I thought it would be at least somewhat useful for sports like squash.SetupI tracked the same squash activity with my F3 connected to my HR strap, and F5 with the optical sensor. Importantly, I had my F5 on my left wrist, wrapped tightly, and I am right handed, so I wasn't doing any racquet swinging with my arm with the F5.ResultsImage linkMetric comparisonCategoryFenix 3 w/strapFenix 5 w/ opticalAverage HR14879Max HR181137Calories burned518171Aerobic TE2.50.5Fenix 3 activity linkFenix 5 activity linkConclusionI know the issue gets solved if I just use the strap for my F5, and I will, but as a test to judge reliability of the optical HR sensor at least with an activity like squash (and I'm assuming also for similar racquet sports like racquetball, badminton, tennis, etc), it's pretty disappointing :(And yes, this is only n=1 and this could be an outlier, but I really wanted to like the optical HR sensor. Unfortunately for me, this means I will be wearing my HR strap for all my squash sessions.I will be testing it out my F5 again tomorrow, but on a city bike.This time, I will be able to compare not only the HR, but also the GPS track.(One of my biggest complaints of the F3 was the shoddy GPS track)Questions for you:How reliable do you think the optical HR is on the F5?For which activities have you seen the best results with the optical HR?For which activities have you seen the worst results with the optical HR?Thoughts on the optical HR?TL;DR - Tested the F5 optical HR sensor vs the chest strap on my old F3 while playing squash for 60 minutes. F5 optical sensor gave disappointing results.Edit: Added the links for each activity",garmin,garmin,0.999999999999998
" Vivoactive HR impressions, and why I took it back Last week, I posted a new thread here asking which would be better for me as a runner (with some other sports infrequently) - the Vivoactive HR or the Fenix 3 HR.  I've been wearing a Fitbit Charge HR for a long while now and I find the wrist-based, 24/7 heart rate measuring to be supremely helpful. I have wanted a more robust device though (with more metrics and data), and I wanted something that was both waterproof (it poured for about 1/3 of my last half-marathon and I worried about my Fitbit the entire time) and something that had native GPS and music controls.The overall consensus was that the Fenix 3 HR would be a better bet.  However, the Vivoactive HR I had on preorder shipped, so it kind of made my decision for me.I spent four days with the Vivoactive HR.  I wore it 24/7 (even in the shower).  I did one run with it each day - two eight mile runs and two 5k runs. Here are my thoughts:Pros:The GPS locked on fast and I had no issues whatsoever with bad GPS info.Everything is configurable. The  face, what order you put your ""apps"" (read: activity types) in, the data fields in each activity (it defaulted to showing my current pace, but I was able to change it to show me overall average pace at a glance instead). Everything on it can pretty much be tweaked to how you like it.The variety of activity types was robust and more than I needed. I don't think I'll be stand up paddle boarding anytime soon.Battery life was great. I used GPS for running everyday and the battery meter barely moved.The move bar rules. That little red bar filling up when I've been reading or writing or playing video games is great and made me want to compulsively walk around or run in place to clear it.Cons:Build quality.  Almost all of my complaints are related to the somewhat shoddy build quality of the device.  It's not a super expensive item, but at $250 it's not an off brand, throwaway electronic either.  The materials all felt substandard (except for the  band which was fine).The screen is abnormally dim. Even if you crank the back light setting to 5, it is insufficient.  Forget about using it at night.  Those bright pictures on the box? Nowhere near reality.The backlight seems to shine out of a small spot on the bottom left of the screen, almost like a behind the scenes flashlight. There is this one super bright spot and then ""normal"" (again dim) illumination of the rest of the screen. It bugged the crap out of me and made it feel cheap. Maybe it was a device defect for my unit.The touchscreen reacts slowly and sometimes misreads your finger taps. There was delay often when swiping up or down to get to different data screens. Also, it's not a huge screen, but my fingers would inevitably hit the wrong thing.  Once I deleted the ""Run"" app completely when I was trying to open up the data field settings. Also using it when sweaty or wet is hard or undoable.Glass smearing / quality - The glass on it smears easily and often, making it look ugly or dirty most of the time. I know, it's a touchscreen and it's going to get fingerprint oil and all that on it, but my phone is also touchscreen and has manages to look ""clean"" even when I put my slimy fingers all over it. The glass (Gorilla Glass? A cheaper substitute?) also looks plasticky and cheap, not like what I would expect for a $250 device.The screen resolution was poor. I don't expect it to be 4k but it still looked pixelated and grainy around the edges of things.I ordered a Fenix 3 HR and took my Vivoactive HR back to Best Buy for a refund when my new  arrived.  I can say unequivocally that the people who responded to my last post were correct to say the Fenix. It has everything I put in the ""Pros"" above and none of the things I put in the ""cons"". It's just a really nice device that feels and performs rock solid. It was more expensive, but it feels like something that is worth the extra money, not like a shitty purse with a brand label slapped on it - the extra money goes for extra quality.",garmin,garmin,0.9999999999999478
"Should I buy a brand new Forerunner 35 or a used Vivoactive(no HR)? Im getting into running with a goal of finishing a my first full marathon in October. Looking for a  to track my runs (both outdoor and indoor runs). My colleague lent me his 4yo  Vivoactive (no HR) so I could try it out. Ive been pretty happy with it. It does everything I need it to do except track heart rate. It has some wear on the bezel but is in decent enough shape. My questions are:For my use case, would you recommend that I buy a brand new Forerunner 35 or this used Vivoactive? The Forerunner 35 is enticing because it would be brand new (though I know the  has been on the market for a few years), has an easy-to-read display (from what I hear) and a wrist HR monitor. The Vivoactive has a colour touch screen and more functionality (I like to golf 4 months out of the year so the course GPS sounds intriguing), though its an older device and has no HR monitor. The new Forerunner 35 retails for $200CAD while a new Vivoactive retails for $350CAD. What do you think is a fair price for the used Vivoactive from my colleague? At what price does it make more sense for me to get the used Vivoactive over the new Forerunner 35?Thanks",garmin,garmin,0.9999999999993927

"Wrist HR Monitor on Fenix 5 Hi guys, I purchased my Fenix 5 a few months ago and love it. I wear it all day every day. The only thing I find curious is the wrist HR monitor. I run Spartan races and use the  to help my track my training whether its lifting, running/trail running, indoor running, elliptical, etc. What I find curious is how low my  is telling me my HR is during my workouts. It is usually fairly accurate during my outdoor running/ trail running, but its real low during weight lifting, elliptical, indoor running, etc. I know the wrist HR monitor is never 100% accurate, but it seems to be a lot lower then it should. For instance, it shows during an elliptical workout when Im breathing hard that my HR is only 84-86 bpm, but when I check my HR on the elliptical machine it shows 140-150 bpm. Before I had the Fenix 5 I had the TomTom Spark. That wrist HR monitor matched fairly well with the elliptical machine bpm. I know people are going to say to get a HR strap but I feel it will just get in the way during other various activities. Is anyone else having these issues on their Fenix 5 or is this normal?Thanks everyone!",garmin,garmin,0.99999999787394

" Device - Steps, Sleep &amp; Heart Rate not in Sync - Solution Hi guys! Just wanted to share with you what I recently found out. When I got my  Vivosmart HR+, I sync'ed it to my wife's account first to test it (as I was testing another device at that time) - after which I then sync'ed it to my account &  used it for the night and found out that the sleep tracking wasn't working. The steps & all day heart rate weren't moving to my  Connect as well. I can totally see those data in my /band. Using it for Run or Walk sync'ed the data through fine. It was frustrating!I've tried a bunch of things: re-installed, reset the device, etc. and yet to no avail. Finally I realized that when I sync it to my wife's  account - I didn't ""retire"" or ""remove"" it from hers. So I ""removed"" it from her account and since then my device has been sync'ed properly. Tonight I'll try sleep tracking and hopefully no issues this time!Just to share - you never know if someone out there had faced this before & got stuck. I noticed someone in Reddit posted something like this 10 months ago via Vivoactive HR - but it's archived.. so thought I start a new one and let you guys know the solution!Update: Sleep tracking worked like a charm!",garmin,garmin,0.9999985016901868
"Any way to sync/send data from  Connect to Google Fit? I got the Vivoactive 3 for Christmas as a replacement for my Pebble (which I loved), and so far I'm liking it, but not being able to sync my step and other fitness data to Google Fit is a real bummer.I've seen this topic covered a few other places on here, the forums, and a few articles, but so far none of those options have worked. I've tried the following:Strava - it looks like it syncs workout data but not step count. I don't know if it actually works as I haven't gone for a run with the  yet.Fitness Syncer - it looks like it has the ability to take  Connect data and send it to Google Fit, but in practice doesn't work. I've tried multiple times and messed with some settings but none of the data from  Connect gets sent to Google Fit.Endomodo - same with Strava, it doesn't appear to support Step Count.MyFitnessPal - started using this when I got the Va3 and it's great for sending calorie intake to both Google and , but it doesn't support step or other fitness data.I liked using Google Fit as a central hub for my fitness data as I've previously used a Pebble which was wonderfully open. This was one of the (many) problems I had with FitBit too. I've given up on  ever natively supporting Google Fit, but I'm open to other solutions.Has anyone found a working service that connects to both apps?

"Why I bought the instinct This post is directed towards a very specific crowd of interested but overly analytic (and often indecisively paralyzed) folk looking for their next (or first) smart . For me it was all about price and aesthetic fit - and I hope this post can help you finally bite the bullet. A, cost-to-features and daily wearability benefits from a more than average fitness guy perspective, kind of post.I recently picked up the Instinct after a few weeks of tremendous research and youtube video surfing. For those of you still on the fence, you've probably heard about DC Rainmaker but if not, you need to check him out: https://www.dcrainmaker.com/ His reviews were amazing and his very detailed cross-comparison tables were a life saver. This post isn't necessarily a break down of the technical aspects of what  provides. If you're a heavy fitness addict, chances are you already know what you need. If you're a casual adventurer who wants helpful tools on demand in a  that can last more than 24hrs while still having smart features, this post is for you.Coming from a Suunto Core, I was looking to upgrade to a  that could relay smart notifications while also providing the updated tech for activities like hiking, general trail wandering, and other random activity tracking (SUP, sailing, etc.). Initially, the Instinct attracted me because of its price tag and its similar, rugged all-black look of my old Core. While a lot of people compare its styling to the old G-Shocks (I see it a little bit), this  looks way better imho (nothing against you nostalgic people). But I was still worried about general wearability (i.e. a rugged fitness  at a work event, etc.) Which lead me to thinking about paying a bit more for aesthetics..So then I went down the rabbit-hole of price. If I was willing to spend $300, I might as well check out the 645 for only $100 more. And why not an extra $50 for the music version. But if I'm already at $450, I might as well look at the Fenix 5 for $500. And if I'm looking at a 2+year old  (which is what also negated the older 935 and 735xt), I might as well look at the 5+ which gives me  Pay, Topo maps, and music storage (and a whole lot more). All of a sudden I'm at $650+, after following the logical train that I don't necessarily mind spending the money if what I'm buying is going to make me happy and last me for at least the next 3+ years.If you live near a FleetFeet or REI (I'm sure other stores allow you to try them on), you should spend a quick trip and go. I found that my quandary was immediately reduced between the 5+ and Instinct based on how the  sat on my wrist alone. The 645 was too small and the 5S+ was small but oddly unproportionate with its thickness on my type of wrist (YMMV, obviously.) The Instinct ended up walking out of the store with me because at $300 I figured I could save the difference in money from the 5+ and buy a Fossil or Tic if I ever wanted a simple, more dressy smart  for other occasions and still pay less while still getting all the function I could even need with the . This also gave me way less FOMO over ConnectIQ. And, if any of you are REI members, you'll get at least $30 back in dividends- essentially 10% off.If this story resonates with any of you casuals out there, I hope it helps ease you decision. In addition to DC Rainmaker, here's a compilation of the most helpful posts for me when deciding which  to buy:https://www.reddit.com/r/pebble/comments/9of04s/_instinct_review_comparisons_to_pebble_2/?ref=share&ref_source=linkhttps://old.reddit.com/r//comments/axdout/instinct_to_get_or_not_to_get/?ref=share&ref_source=linkhttps://old.reddit.com/r//comments/av41or/fenix_5s_plus_vs_forerunner_645_for_runninghiking/?ref=share&ref_source=linkhttps://youtu.be/FwKqbbdNuiEhttps://www.youtube.com/?v=3CrMaaX3BzATL;DR: At $300, the Instinct gave me awesome battery life, simple smart- features (notifications and music controls), and just the right amount of function for my preferred activities (hiking, SUP, etc.) GO TRY ON THE  FIRST - It really does help. I still have $100-250 difference in saved money that I can spend on a daily, true smart  if I want. I'm happy without ConnectIQ.

"Coming from Withings Hello  users. I currently have a Withings/Nokia Steel activity tracker; it's quite basic, tracking steps and sleep. I also have the Withings/Nokia scale. I'm curious to see if any of you came from that platform and moved over to . I'm looking at getting a new activity tracker/fitness  but one that has an HR monitor for all day HR tracking. I was looking at the Nokia one, but it seems to grab a heart rate reading only every 5-10 minutes, which doesn't seem all that useful overall.

HR monitor help Backstory:I've been running with the vivoactive (1st) for the past year. I've been monitoring my hr with the $25 hard plastic  monitor and it's been fun.

For me, the running and sports things are not really something i am actively looking for in a m its more of a bonus, for me, I wanted a  that had utility, and the built in GPS and Glonass was pretty cool. Also I liked the fact that you didnt have to connect a smartphone for it to function. And then one day I saw the epix. And it was even more of what i wanted.

"Forerunner 45 vs 235 Hi guys!I've recently started running after having had knee issues for many years. I did a couch 2 5k program last years and now I'm frequently running 5k's at pretty low speeds. I've used endomondo with a chest strap so far but I'm looking at getting a running  to get more data without needing a subscription, and to be able to glance at my progress while running.I was planning on getting a 235 due to the low price but I waited for the new generation of es, and got a bit turned off by the price point of thr 245. At the same time, I know I'll become nerdy pretty quickly and will want to see all kinds of data to analyze my progress, in other sports as well.So ny question is, would the forerunner 45 be a step down from the 235 or are they roughly equal, with the 245 taking a step up? I don't want the 235 due to the age, but I don't want to pay more for a worse clock. It's really down to the 245 vs the 45, but to understand if the 45 is worth to buy I think I need to understand how it stands against the former obvious choice for me.I'm leaning towards the 245 to be safe for the future, but if the 45 is equal to the 235 feature wise it might be great bang for the buck to me.Edit:Since the price was the biggest issue with the 245, I ordered directly when I found a 10% Discount code.

"Vivosmart HR: a rant I've had various vivosmart devices since 2015, occasionally getting a replacement under warranty for different reasons. Recently, I started swimming laps again and was using it to track things like time, (approximate) heart rate, distance (manually added after), and intensity minutes. I had posted a week or two ago about not being able to add the distance anymore and finally caved and contacted Support. It seems an update was done to severely cripple the device. Rather than at least getting some information about my swims, I was told ""since the device isn't designed to track swimming, the update made changes to that part of activity tracking"". It no longer uses the exercise I get towards my intensity minutes. The distance never shows up when I try to add it. What's the point of a ""swim proof""  that can't track swimming???

Is it true that:You cannot import pre-made routes into  Connect, only import activities and then make them into routes, and then delete the activity so that  does not log it before I have actually done it? (It seems so basic that I figure I must have that wrong, but I can't seem to find a way)You cannot get a route suggestion from two points on the map in either of the two desktop apps? (routeCourse does even use google maps, but still I can't find an option for letting google do the hard work.)I do not understand how such basic functions are not implemented,  being market-leader and all. The best solution I could come up with was this:Follow this excellent guide for turning a google map route into a gpx fileImporting the file to routeCourse, which then magically lets itself be synced to the  when I start routeCourse on it.While this process works beautifully, it is cumbersome.

"Forerunner 35 battery life after update I've had my Forerunner 35 for about a year, and haven't had any issues. Saturday night (3-3-18) it updated. The software it's running now is V3.2. I looked up the update and it seems to be from a few months ago, which I thought was weird, but didn't look into it at all.   After the update, the battery life seems to be significantly worse than it used to be. Monday morning I went on a run. At the beginning of the run I had 1 bar on the battery left. At the end of the run (1 hr 10 minutes) it shut down from low battery. I used to be able to get a full run in without losing a bar.I haven't ran since, but I fully charged it yesterday morning (Tuesday) and have worn it since without any running or activities, just daily wearing. It's down to half battery now (Wed midday). I used to be able to get at least a week out of it without needing to charge with no running or GPS tracking.It is connected to my phone, but I haven't used it any more than a usual day.

"Vivoactive HR for Strength Training/Powerlifting Hey all, wondering if any of you recommend this  as purely tracking strength training workouts. I don't run, occasionally cycle as cardio but 99% of my training is with weights, focusing on Squats, Bench Press and Deadlifts. Just unsure if this  is overkill for that or not, or if I should look at the Vivosmart HR+, or even the HR, or look at more of the Fitbit Charge 2?I should mention that, maintaining or obtaining a certain heart rate is not a goal. I mainly just want to see where I get up to, what I average, and see if I take adequate rest etc. Mostly for casual fun, not anything serious.

"Sleep tracking Issues? Hi guys. I just got a  Vivosmart HR. One of the reasons I wanted it was for use as a sleep tracker. I know I rarely hit REM sleep. I wake about three to five times each night at 1-1.5 hour intervals. I wanted to have some way of tracking this to see if I woke more.It appears the Vivosmart (and I may be wrong) tracks sleep based on HR and movement? However, I was wide awake for the first half of the National Championship game last night, but laid out on the couch with my dog. I got up once during the game to let him outside, once to get something to drink, once to take said drink back to kitchen, and once to plug my phone up. I ended up falling asleep a few minutes into half time. However, my sleep tracker this morning said I was asleep at the start of the game. It does show me ""waking"" on those times when I stood up and walked around, but only has me awake for a total of six minutes during that time.I know I can manually adjust what time I actually went to sleep, but I'm worried that the ""Deep sleep"" and ""light sleep"" times have inaccuracies as well, which is what I'm most concerned about.It shows me in light sleep for the times I was awake until half time, deep sleep when I fell asleep, light sleep again when I woke up and moved to the bedroom, and light sleep when my SO called at the end of the game, while I propped up in bed talking to him. Then, it has me sleeping until 7:51, with several times between 6:30 and 7:51 showing me ""waking up"". I was actually leaving my house at 7:51, and getting ready, feeding the dog, and having steps and stairs tracked while it shows ""light sleep"" in that time period.Is there anyway to get better information out of this for sleep, or am I looking for something more than this can give me?",garmin,garmin,0.9997191493200139

At some point the import button will be grayed out and you should get a hover bubble over it saying &quot;There is not enough space in the Clip Library folder to import the selected clips&quot;.

Cannot create videos bigger than 4GB on Windows 7, and cannot create videos larger than 1920x1080 or frame rates greater than 120fps. These constraints are caused by Microsoft, so they cannot be fixed by us.Ffmpeg: Slow (extremely slow at higher quality settings), high quality. No file size or resolution constraints. Produces smaller files than Media Foundation.Decoder (affects export/sharing and playback):Media Foundation: (Fast over all performance, but low quality and can't read videos that are too big) Uses graphics hardware, but with lower quality (causes some color quality loss causing videos to look gray). Does not work with videos larger than 1080p. Uses lots of memoryFfmpeg: (Very fast on PCs with decent CPUs) Higher quality with no resolution constraints. Uses less memory. CPU power is the limiting factor on speed. Fastest performance for PCs with newer CPUs, very very slow for machines with older or slower CPUs.DXVA: (Really really fast on laptops / notebooks) Uses graphics hardware with comparable quality to ffmpeg. Extremely fast on laptops and other devices with integrated graphics hardware. Slower on machines with dedicated graphics cards. No constraints on resolution.SummaryOver all, if you have a laptop, DXVA is likely your best option. For PC users, if you want high quality and dont mind waiting, use Ffmpeg for everything. If you want your video faster, use Media Foundation for everything.

"optical HR-sensor: How snug Does it Need to be? ""Snug"" seems to be the favourite word for describing the recommended fit of your  for optical HR purposes. But here is the dilemma, as worded by my manual: ""The device should be snug but comfortable.""For me, outside of actual active training where I do not care, snug equals not-so-comfortable. Especially if 'snug' means what our Rainmaking-guru tells us:>Before we move on to the test results, note that optical HR sensor accuracy is rather varied from individual to individual.  Aspects such as skin color, hair density, and position can impact accuracy.  Position and how the band is worn are the most important pieces.  A unit with an optical HR sensor should be snug.  It doesnt need to leave marks, but you shouldnt be able to slide a finger under the band (at least during workouts).  You can wear it a tiny bit looser the rest of the day.He also says that typically, measuring HR is easy when we do not move around that much:>In most cases, the vast majority of the devices on the market today actually nail the first part without issue.  Measuring your HR optically when not in sport/exercise isnt terribly difficult.  Numerous models out there today that suck at sport/exercise are perfectly fine (even great) in non-sport conditions.  Its usually the excessive movement that causes the challenges.So I wonder what your experiences are.

" display question Hello. I'm currently a Fitbit user but I'm becoming very frustrated with my Fitbit and I'm considering giving  a try.I have a Fitbit Charge 3 and I have a few major issues with its display. There is no way to turn on an ""always on"" display mode (or an ""always on during workout"" mode, for that matter), meaning if I'm in the middle of an intense running/bike workout I often have to repeatedly do the wrist-turn thing to get its display to turn on, which can range anywhere to an annoyance to downright dangerous as it is distracting me from looking where I'm running towards. The workout display text size is also very small and it's extremely hard to read while running, meaning I can't easily tell how far I'm going or how long I've been running. Last, the display brightness sucks and if I'm exercising outside in the sunlight it makes the display even harder to read, coupled with the small text size.I've been looking at the Vivoactive 3 or other s in that price range, but wanted to make sure it would actually be an improvement on these problems. Does it have an always on setting? Is the text size/brightness during an outdoors workout sufficient enough that it's easily readable at a quick glance while running?

"Questions about rep counting on the Vivosmart 3 Hello all, I just purchased my first  fitness tracker, the vivosmart 3, and so far Im pretty happy. I do primarily strength training, so Im a fan of the rep counting, however I wanted to know if theres anything more to get out of that feature, or if its just a gimmick. Is there any way to break it down into sets and reps for specific exercises. I had the rep counted on the whole time I was in the gym and just kept clicking start and stop every time I started and ended a new set. Is that how youre supposed to use it? Also, is there anyway to cross check heart rate against what time you were performing a certain exercise? For example Id like to know if my BPM sparked up when doing pull-ups compared to curls. Other than that, any more tips for just using the tracker in general? So far I seem to like it. Any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you! Edit: also is there any way to customize which notifications get pushed to the device? Id like to see texts but nothing else. I was sick of getting notifications for everything so I disabled it.",garmin,garmin,0.9954033933707915

For example, if you had 3000 steps in first half, device crashes, then you take an additional 5000 steps, the 5000 steps don't get added to your previous 3000 steps. You're total for the day just gets updated to 5000, meaning it's off by 3000 steps and their is no way to edit/fix that.  Would that be the same for Intensity Minutes?

"Calories Burned is out of control Hi guys, I just got  Instinct this week and have been really liking it.  However I am having questions about the accuracy of calories burned throughout the day.  I understand that it's an estimation/ballpark but I think it's really off for me and I want to find out if there is any way to adjust it.  Let me explain a bit about my lifestyle first and what  is telling me.I'm very obese -- 6'2"" and 340 lbs (trying to lose and return to running eventually which is the whole point of this).I'd say I have a lightly active lifestyle.  I walk about 10k steps per day (I had Fitbit before), run around a corporate office building all day, use a standing desk and wobble board for the small time that I am actually at my desk.I don't exercise other than NEAT currently (I'd like to start an elliptical maffetone program, but need to achieve better consistency with diet first).I have an RHR of 71 and by nature of being fat and out of shape, I get winded very easily.I wear my instinct on my left wrist, and am left handed.  As far as I can tell,  doesn't have a feature where you tell it you are wearing on your dominant or nondominant arm.When I used Fitbit, up until I got the instinct, it would generally tell me around 5k calories per day, which is somewhat believable (RMR is around 3100 by formula).Now  is telling me that I am burnin almost 8500 calories per day.  3140 basal and 5330 active yesterday, for example.  I wish, but I am not that active.I am thinking that this may be due to my shitty aerobic fitness combined with heart rate tracking.  In the intensity minutes I am seeing 200-300 minutes per day.  I don't know what 'intensity' means in s terms but I do not think this is right.Is there any way to adjust or calibrate this, or do I just have to ignore calorie tracking?

I took the  off of my right wrist and put it on my left and it returned to about where I expected it to be. As I type this, I'm at 70 no matter which wrist it's on.

"""Workaround"" for accurate calorie tracking Since the current method the   uses to track resting calories seems off (in my case, my  says my ""resting"" burn is 2570 calories every day, but I calculate my actual base metabolic rate [BMR] at 1810), I've found an alternate method of tracking caloric burn (for the purposes of weight management) that, based on a few weeks of data, seems to be much more accurate than whatever the heck it is that the Activity app shows.It requires that you use the   in conjunction with MyFitnessPal.Setup:In MyFitnessPal, use the ""Steps"" page on the More... screen to specify your  and Phone as your source of step dataCalculate your BMR (use a site like this one: http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/ )In MyFitnessPal, use the ""Goals"" page on the More... screen to set ""Calories"" (under Nutrition Goals) to your calculated BMR valueAlso on the ""Goals"" screen, make sure your current and goal weight are entered.In the Health app, go to Sources, select MyFitnessPal, and make sure that app is set up to read Weight, Steps, and Workout data.Method:Track your food intake in MyFitnessPal as you normally would. Let MyFitnessPal automatically read your steps and workout data from the  and Activity apps.MyFitnessPal will combine your activity level with your BMR value and give you a surprisingly accurate daily, goal-based target for your caloric intake (the calories ""Remaining"" value on the main screen)Using this method, MyFitnessPal gives me daily targets that precisely match my calculated Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) values. The ""daily burn"" listed in the Activity app remains way too high, meanwhile, and I am now ignoring it altogether. I just focus on meeting my daily move target, and let MyFitnessPal keep me on track with my diet.It works for me -- would love to hear if anyone else can replicate my success!EDIT -- TL;DR:The Activity app's ""resting calories"" value is too high, and you can't override the value  chooses for you. MyFitnessPal (and apps like it) let you pull the ""active calories"" data (which is accurate) from your  and add it to a ""resting""/BMR value that you can set. Ideally this value is based on the scientifically-sound, well-supported Harris-Benedict formula for BMR.The fix for  would be for them to correct their ""resting"" value OR let you override it with a value you calculate yourself.",garmin,applewatch,0.9511207874323918

"Fenix 5s six month anniversary: a love story. tldr: Six months in, I still love my 5S.&nbsp;The full monty:After some decision anxiety about which model to pick, I bought a Fenix 5s this April. I posted some reasoning around my decision (here) as well as my pimping efforts (here) in the sub. Since it has now gone six months, I thought it proper to report back and tell you that I am still in love!Unsurprisingly, I am no longer constantly checking  Connect for my stats, etc, but the fact remains that it is immensely valuable in actual practice, sitting on my wrist for the full day, seven days a week. That says something in my book, since I am not normally a fan of weight on my wrist. (Consequently, my other es the last decades or so have been resting on my desk at work and taken off in the hallway when I get home. But not this one.)My main activities are running, walking and trekking, and now, having had it for the full summer, with all the running-walking-trekking that has entailed, I can only say that it is a true gem. The sports/health-related activities are so quick and easy to use that actually using them becomes second nature after a while (not like it was back in the ol iPhone-as-running-gadget days).That part was not too surprising though. The big surprise for me has been how great the everyday-utility of the  is. While I would not have bought it were it not for the sports applications, the reason I keep  it on all the time is the basic utility that is brings. Being able to immediately notice text messages and incoming phone calls has been surprisingly useful (especially since I often keep my phone on silent). Indeed, in general the fact that it is always on my wrist has made me use things that are harder to access than on my phone, like the timer and alarm clock.All of this would not have been enough, I must however admit, if I did not like the look on my wrist. If the  had  gone for the traditional gps  look, i.e. Star Trek communicator, I would never had gone for a  in this price range. Now, it entered classic sports  land (at least potentially), and with that I felt that I could motivate the price tag. With the women model 5S, the Fenix series now could emulate the classic size of a mens sports  as well, 42 mm. To my aesthetic sensibility (given my small wrist), that was vital.It looked good right off the bat, but to my joy the potential to un-gps its look was very high. A band change and some  face try-outs later, it gained the look that has remained ever since.In sum, while each individual aspect of activity trekking, daily utility and looks would not have been enough to make me keep it on my wrist at all times, in total it has collaborated into a  that I am still fully in love with and that I constantly keep on my wrist.

"Sorry for doubting you, ! So, in addition to my previous posts I ran some comparisons over my workout stats from different devices and also tried the Suunto 3 Fitness. And I have to reevaluate my approach. The main reason I decided to try the Suunto 3 was that I really liked the all black design. But not even after 24 hours the  went where it came from. I can't say a bad word about it, it's an excellent good looking, lightweight and comfortable  that does a decent job with workout tracking via OHR, but the downside is the Suunto app - for what the  can do, there's only a few possibilities to dig data from the app, and that's a shame, not at all comparable with Connect. Also  offers way more customization for the  faces, in case you'd prefer to see your calories instead of steps. But what's important is the workout tracking. I wore both during my training session this morning and ended up with almost identical calories (460 on the , 469 on the Suunto). I just had to try... :)So I have to admit I was wrong, the calorie tracking is okay, or at least matches other devices (including AW3), yes it varies in time and over devices, but I guess generally I was overestimating my burn based on my previous experience. Blame me, I'm sorry and will love and appreciate my s from now on. :) (Still don't like wearing the chest strap though, but it just works better...)So now my biggest problem is what band color I want to buy in addition to the Red/Pink one I originally have on my F645M. :DPS: If anyone of you has a tip for third party  face, that: doesn't drain battery, shows digital time, date, battery life and calories and looks good, please let me know.",garmin,garmin,0.8948376922338088

She can then force touch to access the menu and choose (current chosen option is a check while others are the X's), when she's done the app updates the values!Again, this is pretty basic (ugly) but it's definitely something I'll use and I'm wondering if others will too!",applewatch,applewatch,0.09954266386050996

"The Future: Some thoughts about the   and smart es in general I'm a big tech guy and have ed and worn several smart es over the last few years. My favorite (pre-AW) was the a Pebble and I have high hopes for the next Moto 360.What I think  nails is what I feel is the obvious future. Stick with me, this gets a little fuzzy.Let's look at the iPad and other tablets. There are entire consumer bases where a tablet is just the right amount of computer for them. It sends email, writes docs, browses the web, and displays pictures. With the ever-expanding App Store, it's becoming more and more reasonable to get an iPad over a traditional notebook.Like tablets, I think the   will expose a whole new consumer base where a smart  is just the right amount of communication device. And like the iPad, it's going to really blow up as developers are able to expand its feature set.Right off the bat, I immediately think of all the friends I have that barely ever leave the lock screen, quickly handling notifications as they come in (reply to text, archive email, favorite a tweet, play back voicemail, etc).So what's 's game here and why are they so damned smart? entered this market because they have one thing that Pebble, Google, and Microsoft don't: brilliant third-party developers able to make a living from their platform, contributing to a healthy and fruitful community. Think of all the things that are now part of the OS thanks to third-party apps becoming so popular. knows that their first outing just has to exist so developers can get to work on making the   and early adapter consumers can help refine the use cases. We're not guinea pigs, though. We're just joining this adventure early :)I predict that the ""finish line"" for smart es is a standalone device, with its own SIM card and data plan, with innovative low power antennas, and better ways to keep the thing powered.[UPDATE: Some clarification based on comments]A lot of people keep bringing up that they doubt a  could replace their computer. It's not about replacing your computer, it's about understanding that each device has a different skill set and that there's a category of user out there that the  (likely with OS 3.0) will fulfill all of their needs with the added bonus of being able to do things quickly and right from their wrist.

[Prediction] Most Popular   I am going to predict that four of the following  es will be the most desirable. Sport White or Black bands  SS with white or black sport bandsI think the pricing hits a sweet spot for most consumers willing to pay for something new.I chose white and black because they seem to be the most versatile colors to wear something with.Women will opt for 38mm sports  because they will likely like the lightweight 25g vs 40g 38mm from the SS  .I also predict that the  Sport Black band and black  face are so similar to the   SS with black band that to the consumer may deem the  hard to justify the added cost simply at face value . We all know the increased quality of material etc.My prediction is that people will start lower and buy an entry level   and upgrade their bands when necessary. Why? New category of technology to many. The functionality may not seem appealing to all. People are not in lucrative cellular contracts with credit that can be applied to a new device like an iPhone. This is definitely a luxury piece of tech. People don't know that it's not more than you need but more than they are used to.  and many companies are here to create that need when it doesn't really exist. That is apparent with all the mainstream skepticism on wearable technology you hear about on the news. Thus I predict it will be a slow yet very lucrative market that will complement our desires to get a new ithings every year.These are my predictions.....

"I created a concept for a Reddit app for the  , would love to hear some opinions and feedback on it! #Thank you everyone for the feedback!  I've taken most of the feedback and incorporated it into a mini-redesign.  Changes:App has been slimmed down.  Instead of being able to choose subreddits individually you can view the front page, which contains posts from your subscribed subreddits.  Or you can view all of the posts from all subreddits.Gone is the -style home screen, replaced with a choice between the previously mentioned options.Also yanked was the ability to view individual subreddits on the home screen.  This should help to greatly reduce the scope of the app, and pushes it slightly to be more suitable for a .Front page changed yet again.  This time it is in a list view.  Gone is swiping to upvote/downvote.  Navigating up and down will be done by the digital crown.Hello everyone!First things first:If there are any developers out there who would like to partner with me to make this concept into an actual app, please PM me.The app is tentatively called it.  ( + Reddit = it.)With that out of the way, let's get to some images.##Front-facing mockups####SpringboardThis is the icon for the app, surrounded by all of the apps on your device.####Home ScreenThis is the main home screen of the app.  Here you can choose between the front page of all your subscribed to subreddits, or browse all posts from all of the subreddits.  Note this has changed from before.####Front page/All pageThis is the screen where most of the magic happens.  Here, the posts for the subreddit you are currently in are displayed.  This for example is how the front page might look, and this same visual style will apply to all pages.####Full Screen view, Upvoting/Downvoting a postSimply tapping on a post will enlarge the picture or title of the post so you can view it as large as the screen allows.  Tapping close will bring you back to the subreddit.####Force Touch Context MenuForce touching on a post will bring up a context menu where you can save the post to your Reddit account, share it, or send it to your iPhone where you can view the post within the companion iPhone app.####Short Look NotificationFrom the  Design Guidelines:  ""Short Looks let the user know which app received a notification and are visible only briefly."".In the  app, you will be able to be notified whenever a new post becomes the top post on the front page.  The interval at which this happens can be set within the companion app.  It can update in real time whenever positions change, or for example every 30 minutes.  Whichever you choose.####Long look Notification (1)####Long Look Notification (2) (What you see when you scroll down)From the  Design Guidelines:  ""Long Looks provide more detail about an incoming notification.""In this app, Long Look notifications will show what the current post is (its content and its title.)  From the notification, you will be able to upvote, downvote, or save the post, as well as being able to dismiss the notification.##Mockups of the app on some select  designs.####Here is the mockup.  Unfortunately the template I had only had one option for the  and Edition models.    tl;dr:  Created a design for a Reddit   app.View all the images in this album.##Some info on the iPhone App.I haven't yet designed the iPhone App that would ultimately ship with it.

"[Update] SGS sport band repairs messed up... Emailed Tim So this stupid saga continues from here.  After about 12 days with my 2nd replacement black sport band with space grey pin, it started to wear smooth. It lost the velvety soft feel and looked and felt like shiny plastic rubber. More peeling and flaking especially near the lugs and the pin holes even though I only use one hole. I was already frustrated and disappointed by now since I was on my 3rd band.  So I called Care again and talked with a senior advisor for about 40 minutes while he took down all the details and listened to my story. He had never heard of this issue at all so he wanted all the details from my previous bands and the interactions at the store I went to for the swaps. He saw the notes from the Geniuses and the dismissive tone as the previous two swaps were actually filed as CS codes (customer service exceptions, not valid warranty repairs). I expressed my displeasure and he recommended that he directly ship me a replacement black sport band with space grey pin to avoid an upsetting Genius Bar appointment and also to possibly get a part from a different stock.  I agreed reluctantly as this would be my 4th band...  One day later I get the UPS delivery alert and after a grueling day at work I arrive home to see the brown padded envelope from  waiting on my doorstep. After taking it inside and carefully unpacking it (since I need to peel off the label and return my band in the same envelope), I find the nondescript long white box labeled ""42mm"". I unzip the little white pull tab and slide the box out and what do I find?  A black classic leather buckle.  Care sent me the wrong fucking band.  It's a gorgeous one though. Bright polished stainless steel lugs and buckle and nicely grained leather. I don't feel like it would match with my SGS at all though, and one of the main reasons I picked that model was for the stealthy all matte black look.  At this point I'm exhausted and beyond annoyed and pissed. I repack the leather buckle and without hesitation I compose a polite but direct email to Mr. Tim Cook. It's been a 2 month runaround with nobody taking responsibility for this issue and my satisfaction.  For anyone thinking that I'm nuts or a perfectionist or whatever for complaining about a $50 sport band, try to understand my perspective. It's not a one off incident, check the numerous other posts on this sub. It's only happening to the black sport band with space grey pin as far as I know. I feel like it's wearing out far too quickly for 2 weeks of office use. When it's wearing out it looks like a cheap knockoff band that I got for $5 on the street. It doesn't feel like it's something  worked hard at designing and making for a brand new product. It doesn't look or feel like .  So we'll see if I get a reply from anyone today or this week even. I'm also waiting on a reply from the senior Care advisor to OK me shipping the black classic buckle back immediately.",applewatch,applewatch,3.8162870048782084e-08
"  SS Milanese Loop Shipping Times I ordered the 42mm SS BSB and I have a delivery window of 6/22-6/29.
