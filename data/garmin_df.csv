1,Checking to verify this combination will fit my needs.,"Hi all,


I was pointed to Garmin devices by another subreddit and have been doing research, but because not many people are interested in my exact use-case, I'm not sure what combination of things will fit my exact need.


I do strongman, and I lift in my garage. I want to wear a heart rate monitor (chest strap only: wrist based solutions do not handle HR spikes well) and want to stream data to something (ipad, iphone, macbook, PC are my available options within 5-50 feet.) I want to then export the data to a CSV file.


I was looking at a Garmin heart rate monitor strap: 
http://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Premium-Heart-Monitor-Strap/dp/B00BI9X1QM/ref=pd_bxgy_422_img_3?ie=UTF8&refRID=08AZPYHASE82DB73RVXV


In combination with the ANT+ USB stick:

http://www.amazon.com/Garmin-USB-Stick-Fitness-Devices/dp/B00CM381SQ/ref=pd_bxgy_422_img_3?ie=UTF8&refRID=190SAM3984XKBXF10TAR


Will this allow me to stream my heart rate to this device to be exported later as a CSV? I do not need to view my heart rate during my workouts, but being able to check it occasionally would be nice.


Thanks for your time.",2015-11-23

1,Smart Notifications question...?,"Hi all, I just had a quick question regarding Smart Notifications, specifically on the Fenix 3. 


It is my understanding that any phone notification can be sent over to the watch, which is great. My question is what are we able to do with those notifications via the watch?


I know the watch is not a 'smart' watch in the way we have come to know and understand them, but I just wanted to know what's possible. 


For example, when getting an email, is it possible to read/delete/star/archive via the watch? Similarly, can other such messages from other apps, eg WhatsApp, be interacted with, for example responding with a stock message response? 


I have seen the watch has a calendar/schedule functionality (when paired with a phone). Is this limited to only showing the next 'appointment' on the watch or can one scroll through upcoming appointments too, and maybe even see a whole calendar view?


I'm sure I'll have other questions but these are the main ones for me at the moment. 


Any info regarding the above would be much appreciated. 


Thank you.",2016-01-07

2,VivoSmart vs VivoSmart HR?,"I've searched and searched, but I can't find a direct comparison between the original VivoSmart and the HR. Could anyone tell me the differences in features besides the obvious HR monitor?


For a little background, I'm looking to buy my first real tracker. I have a $20 knockoff fitbit right now that I wanted to try out to convince myself I wanted one in the first place, and found out that I do. The thing is, I really don't exercise that much, so the intended purpose of these wearables aren't really what I'm after. I'm looking at these rather than smart watches for the battery life and small profile. My main criteria for a wearable are:




automatic sleep tracking


multitude of smartphone notifications (call, text, email, calendar, 3rd party apps)


music control


5+ day battery life


better than splash-resistant water resistance (safe for showering and the occasional fall out of a canoe/raft)


Very important - low profile!




That last one is what has be leaning toward the OG VivoSmart. By my research, the Smart is about 7mm thick, and the HR comes in at closer to 12mm thick. The less obtrusive the better. Hence why I am here. If there are many reasons besides the HR monitor to choose the HR over the OG, then I may do that. Otherwise, I will probably stick with the OG.


Should I be looking at any competitors? I checked out the Fitbit Alta too. It looks beautiful, but it is missing some of my criteria, namely the water resistance and the notifications.",2016-02-16

The moment I left the mapped routes 9/10 times it would immediately error out stating there was no path available.

For the most part, I do cross training 4 times a week and cardio 2 times a week, usually indoors as a parent of two young kids. I also go for 30 minute walks everyday at work, and do some hiking on the weekends.


Obviously, I want something waterproof, and that can track steps, sleeps, etc. I know the Vivoactive HR will be a better device, but feel it might be overkill for my current routine.  At the same time, the lack of ANT+ on the vivosmart is a downside, especially for cross training. I also think GPS would be neat for when I go on hikes with my kids.

What I don't get is that the watch tracks ""steps"" when I drive or ride in a car. I would like to wear the watch every day, like one does with the vivofit or the FitBit, but I would have to remember to turn it off every time I get into a car otherwise the steps/mileage would be inaccurate.

2,Refurbished Garmin Forerunner 220 Calorie Burn Problem,"Hey, I'm posting for a friend so bear with me. She can pop on to answer questions if I don't have the answers.


I got my friend a Garmin F15 for her last birthday, but the battery wasn't lasting long enough for the marathon we are running so I got her a refurbished from Amazon Forerunner 220 (listen, she's a really good friend!).


She used the F15 for a year with the old style plastic heart rate strap so she has a good idea of her calorie burn and heart rate trends. 


She's using the 220 with the same strap she used for the F15, but suddenly her calorie burn is recording as 
far
 lower. On an 8 mile run it recorded as 487 calories, and on a 4 mile run it recorded as 280. This is roughly half of what she was burning before.


Her heart rate is registering as the same as it did on the F15 (140-160 depending on speed), and she says she has put in her height and weight correctly. She is very small, 5'0"" and 109lbs, but even so those calorie counts seem absurdly low.


I know there are two different engines for calorie counting but I didn't think the discrepancy would be this large.


I haven't actually gotten a look or tried it myself so I can't say for certain, but she is tech savvy and I have no reason to doubt her reporting. Does anyone have any suggestions before we return it? Do you think this is accurate?


She was hoping to use it for the marathon on 5/1 but it is what it is.",2016-04-22
2,"my garmin stopped detecting timezones correctly, help... :S","Hi,

This used to be automatic, as I turn on the watch and lock the GPS signal, it would set the time correctly. Now I have to do this manually.

8,Navigating with Fenix3?,"Hi all,


I know from reviews that the Fenix 3 can follow a gpx course and show an arrow pointing to the next waypoint. But I don't look at my watch to often while running, so I wanted to know whether it gave a distance estimate to the next turn or a beeping sound some time before a turn.

Background - I run about 50 miles a week, lift weights twice a week and do cycling occasionally and swimming even less occasionally. Currently I'm using a Fitbit charge HR.",2016-04-29

8,"Garmin Vivoactive HR impressions, and why I took it back","Last week, I posted a new thread here asking which would be better for me as a runner (with some other sports infrequently) - the Vivoactive HR or the Fenix 3 HR.  I've been wearing a Fitbit Charge HR for a long while now and I find the wrist-based, 24/7 heart rate measuring to be supremely helpful. I have wanted a more robust device though (with more metrics and data), and I wanted something that was both waterproof (it poured for about 1/3 of my last half-marathon and I worried about my Fitbit the entire time) and something that had native GPS and music controls.


The overall consensus was that the Fenix 3 HR would be a better bet.  However, the Vivoactive HR I had on preorder shipped, so it kind of made my decision for me.


I spent four days with the Vivoactive HR.  I wore it 24/7 (even in the shower).  I did one run with it each day - two eight mile runs and two 5k runs. Here are my thoughts:


Pros:




The GPS locked on fast and I had no issues whatsoever with bad GPS info.




Everything is configurable. The watch face, what order you put your ""apps"" (read: activity types) in, the data fields in each activity (it defaulted to showing my current pace, but I was able to change it to show me overall average pace at a glance instead). Everything on it can pretty much be tweaked to how you like it.




The variety of activity types was robust and more than I needed. I don't think I'll be stand up paddle boarding anytime soon.




Battery life was great. I used GPS for running everyday and the battery meter barely moved.




The move bar rules. That little red bar filling up when I've been reading or writing or playing video games is great and made me want to compulsively walk around or run in place to clear it.






Cons:




Build quality.  Almost all of my complaints are related to the somewhat shoddy build quality of the device.  It's not a super expensive item, but at $250 it's not an off brand, throwaway electronic either.  The materials all felt substandard (except for the watch band which was fine).




The screen is abnormally dim. Even if you crank the back light setting to 5, it is insufficient.  Forget about using it at night.  Those bright pictures on the box? Nowhere near reality.




The backlight seems to shine out of a small spot on the bottom left of the screen, almost like a behind the scenes flashlight. There is this one super bright spot and then ""normal"" (again dim) illumination of the rest of the screen. It bugged the crap out of me and made it feel cheap. Maybe it was a device defect for my unit.




The touchscreen reacts slowly and sometimes misreads your finger taps. There was delay often when swiping up or down to get to different data screens. Also, it's not a huge screen, but my fingers would inevitably hit the wrong thing.  Once I deleted the ""Run"" app completely when I was trying to open up the data field settings. Also using it when sweaty or wet is hard or undoable.




Glass smearing / quality - The glass on it smears easily and often, making it look ugly or dirty most of the time. I know, it's a touchscreen and it's going to get fingerprint oil and all that on it, but my phone is also touchscreen and has manages to look ""clean"" even when I put my slimy fingers all over it. The glass (Gorilla Glass? A cheaper substitute?) also looks plasticky and cheap, not like what I would expect for a $250 device.




The screen resolution was poor. I don't expect it to be 4k but it still looked pixelated and grainy around the edges of things.






I ordered a Fenix 3 HR and took my Vivoactive HR back to Best Buy for a refund when my new watch arrived.  I can say unequivocally that the people who responded to my last post were correct to say the Fenix. It has everything I put in the ""Pros"" above and none of the things I put in the ""cons"". It's just a really nice device that feels and performs rock solid. It was more expensive, but it feels like something that is worth the extra money, not like a shitty purse with a brand label slapped on it - the extra money goes for extra quality.",2016-05-06

I like the idea of an all day fitness tracker because I'd like to make every day more active, even if I can't find time to cycle, but I know that wrist fitness trackers are essentially useless for cycling. I know that you can use a Vivosmart HR to track heart rate and send that to an Edge unit instead of using a heart rate strap, so you get all the info of both. However, I also know that the VSHR only sends info in one direction. Basically is it possible to use the info gathered on an Edge 520 to update say a steps goal or show miles traveled (some sort of conversion to walking/running equivalent) on the VSHR or is this even necessary?

2,Vivoactive HR,"Just got a Vivoactive HR - not had time to test it properly yet. But first off, the syncing seems a bit glitchy. 


It doesn't seem to auto sync in the background like other trackers do, it seems to just sync when you open the app.


Also, it has had just, 'updating', on the screen for about 20 minutes now - is this the normal firmware update in process or has it got stuck somehow? Bit scared to reset it in case I interrupt something vital. (The app just shows 'connected')


Also, I'm a bit worried about the 'sleep times' - I'd much rather you didn't have to set them. As I work mostly night shifts but sometimes switch to days. At the moment I've put my sleep time as 0800 - 1600. But today I'm on a day shift. This won't confuse it and make it think I'm asleep as soon as I stop moving will it?

I assumed it was faulty and my warranty covered a replacement so I took it in and got myself a new one, the exact same problem begun not even a day after I had purchased the new one. 


Today I called Garmin support and the support staff told me that holding the button for ten seconds to 'reset' it would work, miraculously it did and now works. However the problem happened again, I did the reset again and now it works (again).

When I wake up in the morning, I receive notifications just fine, but if I run any apps on my watch then they stop for the rest of the day. The notification is still visible on the phone if I scroll down and look at it, but I don't get the vibration or pop-up anymore.


The firmware on the watch is up to date. I've tried syncing, connecting to my PC via USB, restarting both my phone and watch, repairing the bluetooth connection, and making sure Smart Notifications are enabled both during and not during activities. I really don't know what else to do. It's starting to kill my enjoyment of this watch because notifications was one of the huge selling points for me.


For reference, I am using a Nexus 6P with stock ROM Marshmallow 6.0.1. Funny thing is, I just got this phone two days ago, but my old phone (Moto X Play also on 6.0.1) had the exact same issue. So that's two days with 2 different phones. The only thing the two have in common is Marshmallow, which I hope isn't the problem, because that's not really negotiable for me.

2,HR Garmin Vivoplus review,"I received the HR garmin vivo plus  as a present and have been using it for 2 weeks.
I would like to provide a review based on my experience.
I have the activity tracker on all the time. 


The step counter




when I wake up in the morning I have usually walked 1000+ steps. I am a restless sleeper ha ha ha.
During a 1 hour hiit workout I managed to walk 4000+ steps. So overall the step counter seems too sensitive to be accurate




I  have stairs at home (5 steps to get to each landing). 
Since the beginning the Vivosmart plus has indicated I have walked up 1 flight of stairs ever.
I am not too sure how it determines what a constitutes a flight of stairs but the way I walk/run up the stairs does not seem to meet its criteria




the calorie counter  actually seems really accurate for me, kinda impressed by that.




the pulse monitor also seems accurate however it disconnects when I work out hard.
I have tried tightening and loosening the strap to see if that was the problem but to no avail.
Everytime I got my pulse to 150+ it seemed to just stop tracking. I would get my pulse to 150 
and then look at it  minutes later and it would read 80...umm no. I am ready to puke now.




I took it swimming (I know its not a swimming tracker) but I was hoping it would track steps or something, sadly nope.
The only way it will track steps is if I put it on my ankle and swim with it.
I swim too slow to track steps.






I wish I could turn off the lighting up of the screen when I flip my wrist. At night this is a pain in the a$$.",2016-07-28
1,Stride Length Changing...?,"Hey everybody, I just copy and pasted this from the Garmin Forums, as I don't seem to have much luck over there. Hope you don't mind.


Hey all. I have my stride set to a custom length (5280 ft (1 mile) = 2042 steps). It was correct the first day, and to be honest, I haven't paid a lot of attention to the count just as long as I reach that goal lol. I decided to have a look today and have gone back to the day after I got my VF3 (I only wore it a mile on 7/22/16).


7/29/16: 1 mile = 2635 steps
7/28/16: 1 mile = 2146 steps
7/27/16: 1 mile = 1972 steps
7/26/16: 1 mile = 1967 steps
7/25/16: 1 mile = 1975 steps
7/24/16: 1 mile = 2015 steps
7/23/16: 1 mile = 2006 steps


--


As you can see, it hasn't been correct since I got it (setting custom length was one of the first things I did) but for the most part, I can 'deal' with it. Today it's about 600 steps off, which seems like an awfully lot. Please help, if you can. Thank you.

I have a Fenix3HR, my second one after the first was replaced by Garmin due to buggy satellite acquisition problems.  The 2nd one has worked fine until a few weeks ago.  Now the elevation gain is short by at least 10% on every activity.  


This has been verified by several methods - known routes on century rides (published route had 2300' and the Fenix only registered 1712'), groups of people riding the same route (my results are always lower than everyone else riding), using Garmin's elevation correction feature on Connect, and last night by riding 22 miles using the Fenix and my old Edge 500 on the same ride.  Calibrated both and rode - the Fenix had 1299' gained, the Garmin correction put it at 1584', and the Edge shows 1712'.


I've tried auto calibrate and calibrating at a known elevation immediately preceeding an activity.  I don't know if there is something else I can try at this point.  Garmin's support is generally less than helpful and I really don't want to do another replacement, but I will if nothing else works.  Thanks for any and all assistance.",2016-08-02

3,Fenix 3 HR - Randomly Changes Screen in Trail Run,"*Edit - I should have given feedback.  The problem was definitely the auto climb setting mentioned below.


I have used my Fenix 3 HR Sapphire for a few weeks and love it.  This is the first heart rate monitor I have ever worn for running, so I am really trying to dial in my pace with the appropriate heart rate.  I like to keep the heart rate screen pulled up for several quick checks during my run.  Unfortunately, the watch randomly switches back to the first screen when in the trail run app.  The first screen contains the vertical ascent data, which is totally useless to me in real time.  


I am nearly certain that I am not accidentally pressing scroll buttons because it always seems to switch to the same 1st data field (vertical ascent), which is about four screens above heart rate.  Also, I wear the watch all day every day and never accidentally press scroll buttons during my normal routine.  Also also, this doesn't happen in the normal run app.


There is no pattern as to when this happens.  Sometimes it happens after less than 1 minute, sometimes I run 20 minutes without the random switch.  Each time, I scroll back down to the heart rate screen.


I have firmware version 3.20 which I am told is the latest.


I understand how to edit screens to customize what data is shown on each.  That's not what I'm trying to do.


Does anyone know why the watch randomly switches off the heart rate screen to the useless front screen?  Having to scroll down four screens to get back to heart rate is annoying.


TL;DR - Fenix 3 Sapphire switches off the HR screen randomly when using the trail run app.  Please help me make it stop.  No, I'm not pressing buttons.",2016-08-10

On the start up setup menu after a restore to defaults I select km - it reboots !

4,Keeping My FR 235 clean,"Hey Geddit,


I've had my FR 235 for around 6 months and I absolutely love it. I'm wondering how you all keep your Garmin watches clean? Since the 235 has the HR sensor and the activity tracking I'm wearing it all the time on top of running, so it gets a fair amount of sweat/grime into it. Recently I removed the film off of the back of the watch and it left behind quite a bit of residue. Furthermore, I ready somewhere (don't quote me) that fitness tracking bands have a tendency to break after extended periods of use due to the amount of sweat and stress they're exposed to.


I lightly washed the back of my watch with warm water and some dish detergent but that didn't remove too much of the residue. I'm wondering how you all clean your watches and make sure they last as long as possible.

1,What Garmin would you recommend?,"Hi Redditors, 
Unfortunately I will soon have to get rid of my Basis Peak and I'm looking for a replacement. I'm wondering if you could help me with the choice.
I run - not a lot - between 5 and 10k a week. I always run with my phone for Gps tracking, Strava, and Podcasts. I also workout in the gym.
I don't feel like heart-rate is a priority, it's nice to have it, but honestly I don't do much with that data, I'm not ""that"" serious into cardio training. 
Things I loved about the Peak: vibration for texts and incoming calls on my phone; looks good on the wrist; it detects activity (walking, running, or cycling) automatically. 
So far I'm considering the Garmin Vivosmart HR, the Vivoactive, and the Forerunner 230 (which might be overkill for my running habits, plus seems to be really big). 
First question: which would recommend given the situation?
Second question: Should I wait for a model that is just about to come up that I'm unaware of? The rebate on the vivosmart (from $149 to $99) made me suspicious in this respect. 
EDIT: updated the post by adding the vivoactive to the mix, after suggestion in the comments.",2016-08-21

I just totalled it up myself and I did get over 500,000 but connect has my total for August at 482,000...
I had a bit of an iffy month this month due to injury so I wasn't expecting to get to 500,000. Then a week before the end of the month I realised if I did on average 20,000 steps a day I could reach my goal of 500,000. At a push I can get 20,000 a day so I walked extra every day just to get my totals. I knew for a fact that I had managed it so I was surprised when I looked that my total on connect was so low! So I added up all my daily totals and low and behold my total for August is indeed over 500,000.

3,Vivosmart HR: any way to track step count during an activity?,"Title probably says it all.


I'm using the VS to count my steps for the day and want to know where I am relative to my daily goal. I'd really like to also be using the activity tracking on the device & the Garmin website. When I'm recording an activity I get the new set of data screens which are great and I love that they're configurable and show two items of data at a time... except none of them, in any mode, appear to be able to show me my step count. Even the step count for the tracked activity would be good.


So this means that, if I'm exercising with an eye on my daily steps, I typically don't use the activity mode... which feels like I'm losing half the capability of the device.


So is there any way to combine the two? Get the extra detail of activity tracking AND see what my step count is? Seems a really odd thing to be omitting from those screens.


Edit: revisiting this post to add an update: the VS is a lovely step tracker, like a Fitbit on steroids, but after a couple of months of use I found myself a little frustrated and wanting more - so I caved and bought a Vivoactive HR. Now I have my HR & geo data all in one place (yay!) and also the ability to see 3 different things on the screen at the same time and a choice of dozens of different data items (too many - this thing is astonishing!)... one of which is steps (activity steps rather than total day steps... but it's good enough).",2016-09-08

I'm surprised that Garmin doesn't have this feature front and center and I would have a hard time believing I'm the only person who wants this info.


I've dug around through the options and apps and it looks like the watch only tells me how many calories I've burned from 12am to present on any given day. On Connect, there isn't an option to view more than today's stats but I can edit the URL to look for daily history. There's gotta be a better way!

Fitbit has an entire page of ""issues"" with various (ie. all) Android devices and versions that could have any number of syncing issues.


My #1 requirement is silent alarm (vibrating). I don't even end up caring too much about the fitness part of it - just want the alarm. My #2 requirement is probably reliable syncing with Android (apparently Fitbit doesn't understand this). I don't want a watch (already have a Pebble and won't wear a watch to bed).


Reviews are surprisingly not great on Amazon for the Vivosmart - but at least consistent. But it seems like one of the few with the alarm and form factor that I'm looking for.

When plugged into my Mac via USB, the Garmin Express app recognises my new device and says it's connected but when I go to send workouts to it, Garmin in my browser tells me it can't find any compatible devices. My device is also successfully paired with iPhone 6 via Bluetooth, I have my Garmin workouts open in my phone, but can't get any of it onto the Garmin from there either. 


Running latest version of software on all devices, latest browsers, all updates done, any troubleshooting options I know of are exhausted (restarting devices, unplugging and replugging in USBs, drivers seem correct, downloaded browser plugins, etc). Spent hours trying and I don't think I'm that bad with technology.

1,Forerunner 735tx refuses connection to Ant+ Treadmill,"I just upgraded from a Garmin Forerunner 610 to the 735xt watch. While the 610 could connect to my gym's Ant+ enabled treadmills and stationary bikes, I haven't found a way to get the 735xt to connect to anything other than the HR strap that came with it. The treadmill is a Woodway 4Front. I tried about 5 of them and non showed any signs of connectivity. Once connected with my Garmin 610, actions on the treadmill such as starting or pausing would also start or pause the watch timer, and the treadmill's speed could be seen on the watch, which it used to calculate distance.


I checked 
https://www.thisisant.com/directory/forerunner-735xt/
 to see that two Woodway Desmo treadmills are supported. While only the Desmo line is listed, I know from experience that the 4Front line IS compatible with the 610, so I would have expected similar compatibility with any Ant+ enabled watch.


Could it really be a lack of compatibility with the new 735xt? I called Garmin's front-line support and they pretty much declined to help me with the issue and was quick to push the blame to the treadmill.",2016-10-10

6,New VivoActive HR user. Questions:,"Previous MSBand2 user, and with their recent decommission of the MSBand, I picked up a VAHR yesterday.


I rowed for 45 min last night, approx 1000 strokes, used the indoor rowing app, and it registered a rate of 55-70 BPM the whole time, and spit out a caloric burn of 132 cal. My MSBand2 would have registered a HR range of 90-170 BPM, and about 900-1100cal burn, so I am definitely confused at this point.


From what I am finding on the Garmin forums, apparently it has a hard time with it's optical HR, when indoor rowing, arm movement workouts, crossfit, etc. It has no problem with running or hiking, as the arms aren't flexed, or something.... (
https://rowingmusings.wordpress.com/2016/08/23/vivivoacte-hr-review-of-the-gps-watch-for-rowing/
)


I used the MSBand2 to gauge my HR ranges, and the Garmin forums recommend using the chest strap for HR, and the VAHR for stroke count only, due to reported HR inconsistency.


I relied on the MSBand2 for HIIT, as I could gauge when I was hitting my upper HR levels, and then at low levels for recoveries.


I would be very interested to hear from someone who has used one of these for 3mo+, as I am SURE this is user error, at this point. Too many endurance athletes and triathlon users rely on Garmin, apparently, for it to be off by this much.


Suggestions?

2,Workout Prompts on Garmins,"Hi r/Garmin


I'm hoping someone can provide insight on my inquiry since I don't own a Garmin myself, though I'm very interested in purchasing one in the near future. I've searched all through YouTube for how a workout is setup via Connect then synced to a Garmin. I can't, however, find much on how the Garmin actually prompts you if you have an interval workout synced to your watch.


I'm interested primarily in setting up interval runs to train for a half marathon. So the standard warmup, interval runs with recovery, then a cool down. During the interval runs I want to set up 50% effort, then 80% effort runs, etc. So my question is when you have the workout activated, how does Garmin prompt you when the next interval is up? Is there a vibration on your wrist? A beep? I always listen to music on my iPhone when I run, so I'm hoping there's some sort of vibration feedback from the watch so I know automatically when to stop that interval vs recover.


Also, would there be any possible way to differentiate between an easy effort run vs. harder effort? So would I be able to setup say one vibration for an easy run and two vibrations for a harder run?  Or a long vibration for a cool down, etc. I hope my questions are making sense.

I am coming over from using a Gear Fit2 on my right wrist and a Fitbit Charge HR on my left wrist. 


Few things I noticed right off the bat after my first gym session with it (elliptical & treadmill run) was that the numbers were much different than what my Fitbit recorded and it was off from the treadmill. Now I read a few posts on here where people said it automatically adjusts your stride length with outdoor runs? How many gps runs can make this successful? I had always left my Fitbit the default setting. Also, I haven't found one but is there a good way to track an elliptical session (I used indoor run today)


Still mulling through the book and reading online about what I can do with it. I am a casual runner and would like to mostly use this for treadmill running, elliptical, spin bike, and weight training. Are there any apps or widgets you would recommend I check out?

3,How to remove virb edit garmin watermark,"So if anyone else here doesn't want their footage branded with Garmin after paying $399+ for the camera here is how you remove the annoying Garmin Virb watermark and still use the Gmetrix.


All the watermarks are stored in a folder in Virb Edit. So the idea is to remove them or move them so the program cannot see them.




Close VIRB Edit if you have it open.


Navigate to where you installed it. Default location:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Garmin\VIRB Edit


Navigate to:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Garmin\VIRB Edit\Widgets\images\logos


This is where all the watermarks are stored.


You can probably delete them no problem, but it's always good practice to save files instead of deleting them so if you don't want to delete the files create a new folder in that directory and name it something, I named mine HIDDEN.


Place ALL the files except ""LOGO_CUSTOM"" into the hidden folder OR just delete them. You may need administrator rights to do so as you are modifying C:\




That's it!
If you want to create your own watermark you can modify one of the files in that folder with photoshop and draw your own watermark, the program will still use it but instead of GARMIN VIRB it will say whatever you put there.",2016-10-23

Noone in the area stocked the ANT+ dongle , which I figured I'd need. Came home and read up, saw somewhere that the VAHR does not need a dongle since it's Bluetooth (?). I've tried for the past hour or so to get the HR sensor or even a speed/cadence sensor to show in Zwift, to no avail. I tried connecting the VAHR to my iPhone 6S Plus, as well as my laptop directly, both bluetooth. Both were on the same network, I disabled any background Garmin software. I loaded Zwift Mobile Link on my iPhone. I tried putting the optical HR sensor in broadcast mode. So....

2,Advantage of Older Garmin over Apple Watch?,"Hey guys,
So I've really gotten serious about running now, and I just ran my first marathon (city of oaks, 3:25) and I've been training with my Apple Watch with strava and it's worked pretty well! I have noticed that the GPS over estimates distance though, on the marathon it ended up being a third of a mile off, which meant that I had to do math to figure out my pace and stuff. But all in all, it's been great. Having Siri on my wrist, being able to send and receive texts while running, and the fact it's for more than just running has made it invaluable to me. And I'm always going to run with my iPhone anyways, so that's never going to be a problem. 


However, I have considered getting an older garmin. I was looking at the 405cx because it's $50 used on amazon and it seems to have everything I could want. My question is, what advantage would a garmin give me, would you recommend an old garmin like the 405cx, and if not, what are the must have features in the new ones?

I posted on here a week ago about the advantage of a Garmin over an Apple Watch and I managed to get a Garmin 620 for free, so now I'm one of you! 


I still plan on running with my Apple Watch for music, so I won't need my huge 6+ bouncing in my run belt, but since the 620 does not have heart rate monitoring built in, and it will not cooperate with the Apple Watch's HRM, I have to buy one separately.


So after watching a review of the 620, I found out about all the VO2 max benefits and about the cadence features of the 620, I was comparing my options with HRMs. After reading DC Rainmaker's review of the HRM-RUN, it appears that it is the only HRM that records cadence, but the watch will do that anyways. Additionally, it appears that the VO2 max estimates can work with any Garmin HRM.


My question to you guys is: if I'm on a budget and all I really care about is the VO2 max info, should I just get the [basic Garmin HRM] (

1,HRM Run and the unavoidable rust...,"Hi Garnin owners. I'm a proud owner of one of the first FR620 available and while the watch never needed any repair, my HRM Run was replaced once because of bad HR readings.


After maybe one and half years, it started showing incorrect HR as in under little or no stress and at a moderate pace the HR started increasing to levels which require a lot of stress. Example: a 7:00/mi pace on flat terrain and moderate temperatures usually I have a 150-155 bpm. This is OK. What started going wrong was under the same conditions of better like downhill the HR would go all the way to 185 or more...


When this became recurring I sent the unit and strap (which was great) to Garmin and they game me a new one.


I noticed that the contacts on the unit exhibited a lot of brownish rust.


I made sure to dry the second unit after every training. And so this rust is now only appearing after another one and a half years. And the incorrect readings appear again. Now what I do is, I run for 5 minutes then stop the activity. Then wait a couple minutes and start again, then all is OK.


I run an average 2000 mi/yr... and sweat will get there, that's what I think.


Now its warranty is gone and I ask, any of you experience the same issue?

I have two questions about the Garmin Vivoactive 1st gen (non-HR).




For some reason, the run activity just stopped vibrating and letting me know my mile split times.  I don't think I changed anything.  What do I have to do for it to vibrate and pop up the 2nd mile in 8:30 pace or something screen?  I now have to look down and do the math in my head.  I just don't know what changed or how to fix it or get it back.  Any help would be much appreciated.


I'm a triathlete.  Again, I have the Garmin Vivoactive.  Has someone gone from the VA 1st gen... to the 735XT?  Do you feel that it was a worthy upgrade?  Or does the 735xt not have enough feature upgrades to make the switch in watches worth it?  I keep going back and forth about whether to buy the 735xt because I keep wondering whether the upgrade is worth it.  I have read dcrainmaker's site and done the product comparison calculator between the two watches.  I guess I'd just like personal experiences whether people were happy or didn't think the 735xt did much more for them than the VA1st gen.

Went to

Now - is this an interim thing? Is this just an unfortunate moment to check the state of these devices (aka Connect IQ 2 is brand new and the rollout to all devices happens in phases right now) or .. is that a sign that some devices are just left behind?",2016-12-11

I ride a motorcycle and bicycle, so having hands-free notifications from my phone is a must.


That being said, I have a couple questions:




Can you quick/easily disable all notifications/vibrating -- such as for sleeping or in a movie, without needing to open the phone


Does it display ALL app notifications or only certain ones? Can  you choose which apps to allow notifications from?

The progress indication bar won't even begin to fill (even after hours of waiting).The preparation step works just fine. I've already tried to update Garmin Express but this also didn't do the trick.

-Zero intensity minutes recorded in two weeks. I just finished a 50 minute walk, which was properly recorded with elevated heart rate, and nothing. Ran on the treadmill for 20 minutes the other day, reaching 155 HR, and zero.
-Floor count going crazy. Apparently I climbed 50 floors today in the office walking to the bathroom. There are no stairs.
-Inaccurate sleep counted. I have my bed time set to 12:30am, but if I lie down to watch TV at 10pm, that is counted as sleep time regardless of walking around, taking out the trash etc at 11pm.

5,Garmin Vivoactive HR ?,"Hi everyone. I'm on my 3rd fitbit charge hr and Fitbit's quality is CRAP. They all suffer the same problem. They start to produce small bubbles in the wristband which gradually gets worse until the watch totally falls apart (charge hr strap is not replaceable). It takes 2-4 months before these symptoms start. You would think Fitbit would correct these issues but nope they just keep sending you the same defective product until your warranty period is up (though the CS is good they act like they never heard of this problem before....RIGHTTTTTT!!!). I've started to heard reports that the Charge 2 is starting to have the same symptoms (though the charge 2 straps are replaceable but not cheap). 


So anyways because of this i'm done with fitbit. I do love their software platform though and i was all in with even an aria scale :(. I was also happy with the HR monitoring, sleep tracking, step counting, ect.. 


I have my eyes on a Vivoactive HR. Before i pony up the money though i've heard some reports that the sleep tracking is very inaccurate. How true is this? This is one of my main use cases for the watch so its important to me. Was this an early issue that has been corrected with firmware upgrades or is it some type of big hardware issue that will never be corrected? I find the fitbits sleep tracking to be excellent. Also i find the HR tracking on the fitbit to be good for what i need it for. Hopefully the vivoactives optical hr is comparable.  I understanding there will be reduced accuracy with weight training (though with the vivoactive you can use a chest strap which should make it much more accurate).",2016-12-20

The last time this happened, I hadn't used the unit for at least a week, so I'm thinking it might be related to battery life, but I don't remember the circumstances the other times it had this problem.  It's occurred in both heat and cold (well, not particularly cold - probably in the low-mid forties), so I don't think weather has an effect, either.


I specifically bought another Garmin because I wanted advanced features that the TomTom only offered in conjunction with a mobile app, but this, combined with the fact that the new unit's maps do not contain many addresses that were on my old Nuvi (which I decided to replace after it shut off while driving through D.C. on a hot summer day - it was on my dashboard, but still!)

1,Need some help deciding on a Watch,"Hi All


So for a while now I have been looking at which smartwatch to buy, and I kept coming back to the Fenix3. 


For me, the running and sports things are not really something i am actively looking for in a watchm its more of a bonus, for me, I wanted a watch that had utility, and the built in GPS and Glonass was pretty cool. Also I liked the fact that you didnt have to connect a smartphone for it to function. 


And then one day I saw the epix. And it was even more of what i wanted. The built in maps were amazing, no other smartwatch did that, and it just added to the cool factor and utility. I recently ordered it, and literally before i even received the watch, I read that garmin will no longer be supporting the epix, rendering it effectively dead in the water. So I have to now return the watch (explain the massive price drop). 


My question to you all is, how useful is the GPS from a utility standpoint on the Fenix3. From a GPS standpoint, there is no map on the fenix3, so you can only use the GPS in relation to finding where you are vs where you were, not turning on your gps and knowing exactly where you are in general in the world. 


In a watch I am looking for survival features, useful things like long battery life, ability to locate yourself on a map (which only the epix had) Enough smartphone integration to give you notifications on any app that shows up on your phone. 


Useful sensors like thermometer, barometer altimeter (which fenix has). 


Really the only thing thats keeping me from buying the Fenix3 is the fact that the GPS doesnt seem very useful to me when you dont have any kind of map to place it to. I am hoping i got this wrong and fenix 3 does have some way of telling you were you are.",2016-12-28

2,Sleep tracking Issues?,"Hi guys. I just got a Garmin Vivosmart HR. One of the reasons I wanted it was for use as a sleep tracker. I know I rarely hit REM sleep. I wake about three to five times each night at 1-1.5 hour intervals. I wanted to have some way of tracking this to see if I woke more.


It appears the Vivosmart (and I may be wrong) tracks sleep based on HR and movement? However, I was wide awake for the first half of the National Championship game last night, but laid out on the couch with my dog. I got up once during the game to let him outside, once to get something to drink, once to take said drink back to kitchen, and once to plug my phone up. 


I ended up falling asleep a few minutes into half time. However, my sleep tracker this morning said I was asleep at the start of the game. It does show me ""waking"" on those times when I stood up and walked around, but only has me awake for a total of six minutes during that time.


I know I can manually adjust what time I actually went to sleep, but I'm worried that the ""Deep sleep"" and ""light sleep"" times have inaccuracies as well, which is what I'm most concerned about.


It shows me in light sleep for the times I was awake until half time, deep sleep when I fell asleep, light sleep again when I woke up and moved to the bedroom, and light sleep when my SO called at the end of the game, while I propped up in bed talking to him. Then, it has me sleeping until 7:51, with several times between 6:30 and 7:51 showing me ""waking up"". I was actually leaving my house at 7:51, and getting ready, feeding the dog, and having steps and stairs tracked while it shows ""light sleep"" in that time period.

1,Forerunner 230 poor gPS tracking in Cold weather,"I've recently started having GPS issues with my FR230. Once per run, the track will suddenly jump around and add 1/4 to 1/2 mile to my distance. See here for two examples:


https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activity/1518866785


https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activity/1526429921


This seems to only happen when it's below freezing, but it doesn't happen every time it's below freezing. It is especially likely if the temperature is in the teens (fahrenheit). I've also noticed that it tends to happen around 11 - 15 minutes into the run. My first thought was that my jacket was obstructing the GPS signal, but I've tried wearing the watch on top of my jacket, and that doesn't help.


Other than the cold, it doesn't appear to be weather related. Sometimes it happens when it's clear and sunny, sometimes when it's cloudy and overcast. It doesn't seem to be terrain related either, as it happens on multiple routes, even those with few obstructions, and I've run the same route many times without it occurring. The two example runs above are the same general route, but the tracking problems occurred in two different locations. I've tried factory resetting the device, but that didn't help. It happens regardless of whether the watch is set to GPS only or GPS+GLONASS. 


This is my third Forerunner (previously had a 305 and a 220), and I've never had this problem before. As it is, I can't rely on the watch to tell me how far I have run because I never know if it's added extra distance due to poor tracking, so I'm basically stuck using it as a very expensive stopwatch.


Have any of you encountered this issue? Any ideas what's happening and how to fix it? I've reached out to Garmin support, but I thought I'd see if Reddit had any advice while I wait.",2017-02-04

Just unsure if this watch is overkill for that or not, or if I should look at the Vivosmart HR+, or even the HR, or look at more of the Fitbit Charge 2?


I should mention that, maintaining or obtaining a certain heart rate is not a goal. I mainly just want to see where I get up to, what I average, and see if I take adequate rest etc. Mostly for casual fun, not anything serious. I do enjoy the sleep tracking and notifications and stuff too.",2017-02-06
1,Fenix 2 Rebooting when starting activity,"Today my Fenix 2 started rebooting as soon as I started any activity (run, workout). After a while, it started rebooting itself. After reseting, hard factory reset, and all, I've contacted support. This was the response:
""We can offer an exchange. The cost of an exchange is $110, and Garmin will issue you a Return Material Authorization number (RMA). We will wait for your unit to arrive and then process the exchange which will take about 10 - 14 business days. You will receive a newly overhauled Fenix 2 as an exchange which will come with a 90 day warranty.""


Given it is pretty new (I've bought a year ago but just started using it now), I don't want to pay half its price to get an 'overhauled' unit.


Googling it, I've found that doing a hard reset (turn off, turn on holding down button) and after that removing all content from the 'mass storage' fixed the unit and it is not rebooting anymore.


So, Garmin would charge $110 for this? Clearly this is not a hardware problem, but a software one.

Does anyone have opinions on these two watches? It sounds like one of the main differences in features is the optical hr. I currently don't track hr, so I don't think I'll miss this. Aside from that it looks like the 230 has more running stats and the ability to add apps.

Lately, my averages have been between 135 and 145 for a similar level of exertion and will max out at 155. I thought little of it, assuming it was just something to do with my physiological state at the time, but today during a 6 mile run, my average heart rate was 122 with a max of 150 when I was going about as hard as I could for ~half a mile.


When I got in the shower, heart rate started dropping down to the 60s not even 5 minutes after my run where it's usually 100-115. I took the watch off of my right wrist and put it on my left and it returned to about where I expected it to be. As I type this, I'm at 70 no matter which wrist it's on. Also worth noting, I read that hair can interfere with optical heart rate monitors so I shaved a patch of my wrist hair off on my right wrist. Any ideas? It frustrates the hell out of me coming back from a semi-hard run and having Garmin tell me it barely maintained my fitness level lol.

Went for a short run today, did some intervals & stuff to try it out.
Now when I look at the data, Garmin Connect admits my run lasted > 30 mins, and was > 6km. It admits that my pulse went up quite high at times. Yet it states that I burned 55 calories only, and the ""training effect"" was 1.0 (=a lazy maintenance workout). 

Imgur link to screenshot


Is this some known bug? Or am I totally messing up when using this thing? I guess I can maybe edit the number of calories burned, making up some number, I just wonder if this is something I am misunderstanding and thus should be fixed before my next run. 
It's not the end of the world if this workout is ""wasted"", but I would love to not have this happen eg during a race. And also, I am a scientist and it really bugs me when I don't understand things :)

Used a Fenix 3 to successfully navigate a 1,200km audax in a foreign country before. However, during the course creation in the Garmin Connect website, it was only limited up to 400km, and had to split up the navigation courses. Planning to get a   more dedicated cycling unit.

Are there Edge units that can save the entire 1,200km route or
even longer ones? Just find it interesting that a lot of
Tour Divide/ TransAM riders use Etrex 30's more. Is it because
it uses AA's and has a longer battery life?

Prefer longer battery life rather than hires colored screens.

I have had trouble with my old Pebble maintaining connection with my iPhone and so am a little skeptical of the reliability of the connection, especially if I'm constantly moving out of range and back into range (my Pebble would rarely reconnect).  Because I've had bad luck in the past, I'm thinking that the Forerunners with WiFi sync would be more reliable, but they are also more expensive.  I actually don't care that much about the smartwatch features. I already have an apple watch. I just don't really like running with it.

7,Any new model replacements for the 235 or the Vivoactive HR coming soon?,"I know it is all speculation, but maybe somebody knows when Garmin typically updates popular models?   I did read that CES just came and gone and only the Fenix 5 was announced.


I'm mainly interested in the 235 and the Vivoactive HR.  I much prefer the look to the 235 and the 1 second recording, but want the accurate barometer altimeter of the VHR, and the lower price on the VHR is nice.


I'm leaning towards the 235.  It was announced in 2015, so in tech terms, its old.    
http://gpsrumors.com/
 says its probably a good buy as it's still pretty new, but there are rumors around that the 235 will be upgraded.


I've made the mistake of buying something and very soon after it was upgraded, so I'm trying to avoid that.  


Any ideas?",2017-03-05

2,"Workout ""send to device"" not working anymore?","I have a Garmin Fenix 2 for a few years and during this time i created a couple of workouts. Today I went to the Garmin Connect website and clicked on ""Send to device"" for one of the workouts, and a dialog popped up saying I should download Garmin Express.


I have Garmin Express, that is how my activities get transferred to Garmin Connect.


I tried everything else I could think of: disabling the ad block, trying from IE and Firefox, installing the latest Garmin Express... nothing worked. I can't send my workouts to my watch.


I can't send anything else for that matter (like tracks), but that doesn't matter since I can download tracks as GPX and then just copy the files. But for workouts, there is no option to save them to files.

1,looking to purchase a gps device for my car. Questions about Nuvicam LMTHD and DriveAssist.,"I want a gps because we will be taking several trips this year driving and would like to avoid using data on my smartphone. i like this device as it has a dashcam. i know there is also the driveassist that also has a dashcam, but slightly smaller, which doesnt really bother me. but i notice the main dfference is in the traffic service used, where DriveAssist uses Garmin Traffic and NuviCam uses HD digital traffic. From what i read in the website it seems the HD traffic updates more frequently than the Garmin Traffic. Am i understanding this correctly? And




If HD traffic isnt available in an area im driving, can the Nuvicam resort back to Garmin Traffic as a default or would there be no traffic updates available at all?




I see there is also a Live Traffic service available. is this a free option to add on to a nuvi or driveassist?




Since the Live Traffic service uses your smartphone data, is this going to be more accurate and faster than what service HD Digital traffic offers?




would data usage using Live Traffic service be as much as if i were to just use my smartphone using google maps?




is the difference between the hd digital traffic and garmin traffic services minimal enough where i should just save the $100 and get the DriveAssist instead of the Nuvicam?

I was looking things up on the internet and I really liked the Forerunner 235. The design, the screen, HR sensor, GPS. The price is about AU$399-$469 here. 


However I have found a 630 on sale for $299!!! But I probably won't be using this watch to its full potential... VO2, cadence etc is good to have. But I don't race so I probably won't even be touching the lactate threshold stuff. I don't like that it doesn't have a wrist HRM and the bezels on the watch face is a little large. Definitely prefer the 235's design. 


Bottom line: should I get the 630? For that price it's such a bargain. It would also mean having to wear a chest strap.

1,Can't figure out media player song sorting,"I just purchased a Zumo 595 for my bike and can't figure out how to get my albums to show up w/ songs in the correct order in the media player.  I have a large music collection and the meta data is all correct for song and disc numbers.


At first I thought the problem was that the Garmin ignored the disc # so if song #'s restarted at 1 for each disc, that would cause all ""song 1's"" to appear before all ""song 2's"" in the media player.


I went though and updated all of my albums so the song #'s always increment (ie if disc 1 has 10 songs, disc 2 starts at song 11...), but the songs are still out of order.


Is this a known problem? It's crazy something this simple is not working.  And some of my albums seem to be in the right order but I can't see any obvious difference between the ones that are correct and the ones that are wrong.

My question: is there anywhere to post ideas Garmin might be interested in pursuing? I'm not sure if they'd even listen, but I mean...come on, why isn't there a simple stop watch on this thing? This stuff shouldn't be TOO hard to develop and implement. Thanks for reading.",2017-03-14
4,Vivoactive HR - active calories WAY off,"I'm hoping someone here can shed some light on the problem I'm having with my new VAHR. I just upgraded from a Fitbit Charge HR that disintegrated for the third time in 18 months as I have been looking to improve my running and figured a real GPS-enabled device would be great for training this summer. I really like the interface, I haven't had many problems with syncing or setup, and it is a huge upgrade from a Charge HR in terms of features. But... the active calorie burn is WAY off.


I'm a 5'8"" woman, 31, about 144lbs. My daily TDEE is around 1780. On a normal day walking around the office but not doing anything else, that's around what I burn (plus or minus 100 calories either way). I track my food on MFP and have successfully lost quite a lot of weight and am now maintaining, so I have good reason to rely on these numbers. I've been using a Fitbit for activity tracking and never gained or lost while maintaining based on the numbers it gave me.


With my VAHR, it's like down is suddenly up. Yesterday, other than a 50-minute workout (avg HR around 148), I basically sat on my butt all day. I even took a nap! Normally, that workout would be good for maybe 450 calories for me, which is great - a TDEE of maybe 2,200 = extra snacks But the VAHR calculated my 'active' calories at more than 
1600
, giving me a total TDEE for the day of 3,175. Like I said, I'm a medium-tall, not overly large woman. The funny thing is that it calculated the exercise calories basically at the right level - so I started wondering if it was double-counting the HR/activity-tracker calories somehow.


Today the same thing happened, except I didn't even work out. I walked to and from the subway/bus, probably about 20 minutes or 30 minutes of walking total all day. In between transit, I was sitting at an event. The entire day, basically sedentary. Yet my VAHR seems convinced that I've burned 
1200
 active calories on top of my BMR. That's 2,500 calories for the day! That's a level I MIGHT get to on a pre-winter-sabbatical long run day or when I walk basically all day. 


I Facebook-messaged Garmin about this and I'm waiting for a reply, but I'm wondering if anyone else has had this problem and fixed it? I really like this device, but I really, really value the activity-tracking side of it, and not using an activity tracker for that purpose seems crazy to me. Other than this, it seems to be working great, but I can't find anything that might actually solve this problem. Help? Please?",2017-03-15

The difference in the calories being 25% with very little deviance in the actual workout.  What other factor that I haven't listed (that isn't a constant such as age and weight) could I be missing in their calculation?  


I've only had this thing for 2 weeks but I've seen the same   inconsistencies in calculating calories for running as well.  Everything else (distance, time, speed, etc) seems to be pretty consistent.  Is there something I can do to normalize the results so that, if nothing else, I can at least get some consistency in them?

Thing is, the bluetooth connection exists in my BT settings in my Pixel, and my Nav V definitely still has the connection in there. But every time I reboot... sure as heck every time I have to go in and unpair it at both ends and re-pair it again like the first time I used it.


Is this a bug with Smartphone Link? Anyone else seen a similar problem or found a solution? It's a minor frustration, but still rather annoying when I love the information SPL provides me.

1,Training Effect,"Last week I ran about 11 km and my trusty FR 235 calculated a training effect of 3.6.  A few days later I was going through the settings and noticed that the heart rate zones, which were calculated automatically, were way off. My max heart rate was 10 beats higher than anything I normally experience.  So I updated the max heart rate and the zones were recalculated.


Yesterday I ran the same route in a few minutes less time and my Training Effect was 5.  


The fact that the Training Effect is so dependent on heart rate zones, which I can change however I wish, is a little frustrating, but the main concern I have is I don't know WHY my training effect is what it is.  In fact, I was a lot more exhausted after my run yesterday than the run last week, so I do believe that I was working harder for some reason (it was warmer, for instance).  But it'd be nice to know that the long hill after 8KM was the one that racked up all the TE points, for example (which is my instinct: that hill kicked my ass).  If I wanted to do a run with a TE in the 4's so I'm not over-exerting myself it's not clear what to do. Run slower? Run less distance?  


Right now, Training Effect seems like some voodoo metric no better or worse than other proprietary metrics like Strava Suffer Score or Smashrun's Performance Index.  It seems like Garmin could at least provide a intermediate Training Index after every 15 minutes or whatever is required to calculate the number so you can see what's going on.",2017-04-09

4,optical HR-sensor: How snug Does it Need to be?,"""Snug"" seems to be the favourite word for describing the recommended fit of your watch for optical HR purposes. But here is the dilemma, as worded by my manual: ""The device should be snug but comfortable.""


For me, outside of actual active training where I do not care, snug equals not-so-comfortable. Especially if 'snug' means what our Rainmaking-guru tells us:


>Before we move on to the test results, note that optical HR sensor accuracy is rather varied from individual to individual.  Aspects such as skin color, hair density, and position can impact accuracy.  Position and how the band is worn are 
the most important
 pieces.  A unit with an optical HR sensor should be snug.  It doesn’t need to leave marks, but you shouldn’t be able to slide a finger under the band (at least during workouts).  You can wear it a tiny bit looser the rest of the day.


He also says that typically, measuring HR is easy when we do not move around that much:


>In most cases, the vast majority of the devices on the market today actually nail the first part without issue.  Measuring your HR optically when not in sport/exercise isn’t terribly difficult.  Numerous models out there today that suck at sport/exercise are perfectly fine (even great) in non-sport conditions.  It’s usually the excessive movement that causes the challenges.


So I wonder what your experiences are. My current strategy is, as endorsed by our DC Rainmaker above, to leave it looser for regular work, and then tighten it when running. What are your strategies and/or experiences?",2017-04-14

4,My reasons for choosing the 5s over the 5/5x.,"I had a really hard time deciding between which Fenix 5 model to choose, and since it seems as if I am not the only one, let me share my thoughts. Let me first say that I think they are all fine-looking watches, so my assessment below should be read in relative terms.


Here it goes: My planned use case for the fenix 5 was a watch to use all day (and night), and for that I wanted it to be comfortable enough and decent-looking enough. While male, I have rather small wrists (approximately 16 mm circumference, c.f. pic below for 5s fit on wrist), so I figured the 5x would probably be too large, but I ordered all three of them home to compare. After deciding that the 5x was indeed a non-option compared to the others, I took turns wearing the 5 and the 5s. I really wanted to prefer the 5 due to the larger screen size and extended battery life, perfect for my hiking and eye-sight. But it was not long until it became clear to me that the 5s, for me, simply was preferable.


In short, it came down to size and looks. For a wrist as small as mine, I thought it simply looked better. 42 mm is still a rather decent size for a watch, and this would be my 24/7, so then I wanted to be able to wear it to work as well as when running or hiking. In addition, while I really liked the look also of the 5 in the abstract, when it was on my wrist I thought it was too much in-my-face, its visible screws sticking out in a way I did not like, aesthetically speaking. The 5s looked more neutral in a, for my use case, good way.


Hence, in my book the 5s was the distinct winner in the looks-while-on-the-wirst department as well as the comfortable fit/weight department. My remaining doubt were about the screen size/readability and battery life. There, the other models had the definitive upper hand. In the end, I judged both readability and battery life to be good-enough. 24 versus 14 GPS hours is of course a significant difference, as is 60 vs 35 hours in Ultra Trac mode. While I can confirm that the readability, in my experience, is just fine, I guess I will have to bring that extra battery when my hikes are longer than a weekend. That is a comparable bummer, of course, but for me, that was a trade-off that I could live with.


Six days into my 5s, I can only confirm that I am super-happy.

I am trying to get a grip on the best way to map out the summer hikes to use on my Fenix 5S, and I must admit that I am a bit confused as to my options here. There is a course creator on GC which syncs with my watch, but then there also seem to be third-party apps such as dwMap. I first thought the latter would enable me to download maps to the watch, like offline map apps on my iPhone, but to me it just seems to duplicate what the native courses thingy already does. So:




Am I missing something here? Does the dwMap app do more than the native courses and navigational tools on my watch?


Are there not any 3rd party apps I can use to get actual map data onboard? If no, why the heck not? Is it a memory issue or is there some other reason I miss here? (Granted there are real-estate issues with a 218x218 screen, but it sure would be nice to get a copy of my printed map to the watch so it can instantly show me where on it I am.

From googling (and the answers to a previous post of mine) it seems as if the native Garmin Connect Course creator or the routeCourse app are my two best options. But both of them seem strangely limited, and so I want to ask here to see if I got it right. Is it true that:




You cannot import pre-made routes into Garmin Connect, only import activities and then make them into routes, and then delete the activity so that Garmin does not log it before I have actually done it? (It seems so basic that I figure I must have that wrong, but I can't seem to find a way)


You cannot get a route suggestion from two points on the map in either of the two desktop apps? (routeCourse does even use google maps, but still I can't find an option for letting google do the hard work.)




I do not understand how such basic functions are not implemented, Garmin being market-leader and all. The best solution I could come up with was this:




Follow 
this excellent guide for turning a google map route into a gpx file


Importing the file to routeCourse, which then magically lets itself be synced to the watch when I start routeCourse on it.




While this process works beautifully, it is cumbersome. And it makes me a little sad that such a lovely wonder of a watch does not have better app support than what Garmin Connect provides. While I understand that Garmin makes money on the hardware, not the software, they must realise that for the user, these two aspects are interconnected.",2017-05-02

3,vívosmart HR+ to fenix 5 -- large discrepancy in caloric expenditure,"A couple of weeks ago I went from a Vivosmart HR+ to a Fenix 5. I've noticed that the calories reported for workouts are consistently lower (quite considerably) on the Fenix 5 than for very similar workouts done with the Vivosmart.


&nbsp;


Here's one example:


https://postimg.org/image/ovkpfzrof/
 - Fenix 5


https://postimg.org/image/89356wyqn/
 - Vivosmart HR+


&nbsp;


Another is my cycle route to work, which is 24km and always basically the same. The Fenix 5 reported 414 calories with an average HR of 136, while on a lower effort day (1.5 kph slower average speed) the Vivosmart reported 531 with an average HR of 123. And one more, a fast 5km run I do regularly: Fenix 5 216 calories with HR 157, Vivosmart 316 calories / HR 165.


&nbsp;


Now slight differences in the optical HR sensor between devices are to be expected and I would never expect 100% accuracy, but  surely caloric expenditure should just be some function of HR/time/BMR and that should be the same between devices. So why does the Vivosmart report 30-45% greater caloric expenditure for basically the same workouts, and which is more accurate?

I know since it's wrist-based it's not going to be the most accurate, but usually it'll be off for a minute or two before getting back on track so the average winds up being roughly what it should be. Lately, though, about half my HR graphs from runs have just been either lines with a 
constant slope up
 or a 
constant slope for a while and then the exact same for the rest of the run
 (want to note that those sudden dips don't line up with rest stops, either; they're just random downward spikes). Is this some sort of software bug?

Since then it is constant, even though I did a few activities (mostly trail runs, which are not very fast). The web page shows the value for every Monday, while the Android app shows points apparently for each activity (5 activities total). If it's using activity data, I would expect some variation, but it seems to be stuck. Even more confusing, on the watch itself it looks like I can

The higher models are too expensive for me, I'm looking for something $250 or under. The only difference between the 230 and 235 is the heart rate monitor, and I'm not  even sure how much I'll use it. Is it worth it? amazon has the 230 for $169 right now and that's hard to beat if you compar eit to the FR35 which is the exact same price on there right now. The 235 is still $329.

1,GARMIN INDEX SCALE &lt;MAC ADDRESS&gt;,"So, simple answer I used my cellphone as a mobile hotspot to connect my garmin index smart scale to it. My cellphone then showed me the mac address of the connected device.

It has taken me a couple of days to figure out how to get a mac address off this thing. Finally said, F@#k it and purchased the Ant+ to hook it up to my pc and just have the information sent there. It says the Ant+ stick is only used for initial set up.
I used the Garmin Connect on my PC with the Ant+ stick to connect to my hotspot, found the mac address logged it in my internet service and then reconnected to my internet service.


I tried using the App on my phone and mobile hotspot but I couldn't get it to work that way, so maybe you have to borrow a buddy's mobile hot spot and do it that way.

2,Buying advice,"Hello Guys,


I am looking at buying my first gps watch. Until now I was using my smartphone to track my runs, listen to music and so on.


I am planning on using a garmin watch to track run & heart rate (using a chest strap) and Mighty to play spotify so no interest in music capabilities. 


Optical heart rate I find it nice to have your 24/7 heart rate monitored but I will not use it when doing sport. I am not planning to swim a lot and am not interested in swimming metrics (just interested in monitoring heart rate during this maybe). Same for cycling.


Given those information, what would be your recommendation ? 235 seems the way to go. I also looked at the 735 which has strava live segments but I think I can get by the function by syncing the data after the run and check how I actually did against others after the run. Turn by turn navigation is not a feature I attach importance to. 


Only thing I could buy the 735 for is its (apparently) more responsive behaviour and is ability to be more future proof regarding garmin connect apps.


What are your thoughts on this ?

5,Selling Samsung and buying Garmin. Should I expect the same issues?,"So I have the Samsung Gear S3. I bought it with a focus of running in mind but I also wanted something feature packed that looked nice. 5 months later, I have all these issues running with it which makes me run with both the watch and my phone for better accuracy. I feel like I forgot what the main reason was why I bought the watch. This is why I have decided to go with a manufacturer known for running.


Here are the issues I have to which I would like to know if buying a Garmin will fix:




Accuracy. Some times the watch will not connect to GPS and there is no GPS icon to indicate if and when this happens. My entire run is ruined.




The screen goes to sleep, which only shows my watch face. Therefore when running I need to raise my wrist and wait 1-2 seconds for the actual run data to come on... or I need to press a button.




The actual UI of the watch during a run. With the samsung, it  only shows 2 points of data. Time and Heart Rate. For everything else, I need to rotate the bezel. With a 42mm screen you would think they can show time/dis/pace/HR. Or at least 3 out of 4.






So I guess my question is, does the forerunner 235/630, Fenix 3/5 or any other model fix these issues?

For the first 5km on the bike, my HR stayed around 125-130, but then suddenly dropped to 90-100. I didn't change effort at all.

Could the baby oil on the skin be affecting the reading of my heartrate, or could it be something else?


(Note: The optical sensor and strap give equal readings when in training. However I've been having trouble reaching high heart rates for high intensity. (When I do hard intervals in training, my heart rate rarely cracks 120BPM, despite being a zone 4-5 effort)

1,735XT heart rate dropping out randomly,"I got a 735xt a few weeks ago and have been loving it, wearing it almost every day.

I'm confident I am wearing it correctly as it has consistently read heart rate for hours of biking, running, and climbing. 


The only pattern I see is it may happen after I don't wear the watch for a day while it stays on. And, so far, once I reset the watch, the problem goes away. 


Anyone have experience with this? Should I return and swap the watch for another one? Is this a known issue and resetting the watch always fixes it? Should I turn the watch off when I'm done wearing it for the day?

I bought myself Fenix 5X, had it on my wrist for the first time when I was traveling to work this morning, I am usually using public transport so I did.

Roads are quite bumpy around here so I understand that it could be misleading for the sensor but does it have to be? 
During 50 minutes long ride it counted around 600 'steps',  I find it really annoying because is quite a huge number (in my eyes).

7,[experiment] Fenix 5 Optical hR vs fenix 3 with HR strap (Squash),"Hey r/Garmin,
I just upgraded to the Fenix 5 Sapphire (Japan edition) after owning a Fenix 3 Sapphire (US edition) for more than a year and a half.


I know my F3 was more than enough for my fitness tracking (mostly weightlifting/trail running/hiking/road running/cycling/squash) needs, but I just couldn't stop fantasizing about the F5 with the better battery life, smaller size, crispier screen, better GUI, and most of all, the optical HR sensor.


I love my HR data, so I knew that I would still be using the HR strap on my F5 for my activities, but I wanted to test out the accuracy of the optical HR vs the HR strap with different activities.


And I'm sad to say, 
I'm pretty disappointed
.
I know that the optical HR sensor has its limits and is not accurate for most activities especially things like weightlifting, but I thought it would be at least somewhat useful for sports like squash.


Setup


I tracked the same squash activity with my F3 connected to my HR strap, and F5 with the optical sensor. Importantly, I had my F5 on my left wrist, wrapped tightly, and I am right handed, so I wasn't doing any racquet swinging with my arm with the F5.

Conclusion


I know the issue gets solved if I just use the strap for my F5, and I will, but as a test to judge reliability of the optical HR sensor at least with an activity like squash (and I'm assuming also for similar racquet sports like racquetball, badminton, tennis, etc), it's pretty disappointing :(


And yes, this is only n=1 and this could be an outlier, but I really wanted to like the optical HR sensor. Unfortunately for me, this means I will be wearing my HR strap for all my squash sessions.


I will be testing it out my F5 again tomorrow, but on a city bike.
This time, I will be able to compare not only the HR, but also the GPS track.
(One of my biggest complaints of the F3 was the shoddy GPS track)


Questions for you:




How reliable do you think the optical HR is on the F5?


For which activities have you seen the best results with the optical HR?


For which activities have you seen the worst results with the optical HR?


Thoughts on the optical HR?




TL;DR
 - Tested the F5 optical HR sensor vs the chest strap on my old F3 while playing squash for 60 minutes. F5 optical sensor gave disappointing results.

1,Garmin fenix 5x and activity class,"Over the past couple days I have been playing with my Fenix 5x and the activity class settings on Garmin connect. I have a few questions for the community. My daily caloric burn is abnormally large, like 3100 or 3200 calories for daily office setting that takes around 7000 to 9000 steps and no exercise. I have taken two months off from exercising because of a shoulder injury but I put myself in a fair athletic condition. So is the Fenix 5x overestimating my calories or am I really burning 3000+ calories. Looking at my resting HR is 54 and throughout the day it hovers around 75-90 HR for regular activity. Does anyone think they are burning too many calories throughout the day like I am? Also do you use the activity class in Garmin connect? Do you see a difference?",2017-06-10

2,New Vivoactive HR+ Owner: Questions about tracking different types of activities,"Hi all,


Apologies in advance for the dumb question. Got my Vivoactive HR+ a week ago and still figuring out how to best use it when I workout. I went for a run to calibrate the HR monitor and tracked that using the 'Run' activity and all worked smoothly.


I worked out yesterday doing some weight training and selected the 'Other' activity. Is there a way to create manual activities that will show up on my device so I don't have to mark unique activities as 'Other' and manually change it later in the app? Also, if I go cycling, do I just select Cardio outdoor and the app will detect I'm biking? Or do I need to create an activity for that?

2,Please help! My Garmin vivoactive HR is recording inaccurate swim distances. What can I do to fix it? (x-posted to swimming),"Hi guys, I've been having some trouble tracking swim distances with my Vivoactive HR. Garmin support hasn't been super helpful so I was hoping you guys might have some tips for getting more accurate results.


I'm a beginner swimmer, I just started a few months ago. Very shortly after starting I replaced my FiBit Charge HR with a Garmin Vivoactive HR to track my swims, but unfortunately it's been pretty useless. I've been swimming with it a total of 12 times and every time the distance has been innacurate, sometimes even showing double the distance. Here are a few examples: 




Recorded distance: 2900m Actual Distance: 1500m




Recorded Distance: 1550m Actual Distance: 1000m




Recorded Distance: 1800m Actual Distance 1200m






After seven inaccurate recordings like this Garmin support told me to replace the watch with a new one. I've been swimming with the new watch 5 times 
and it still isn't tracking distances correctly. It's been slightly better. A week ago it got within 300 meters of my actual distance but it's also been as far off as 800 meters. 


I haven't bothered contacting support again as they were totally baffled by the issue the first time so don't think they'll be able to do anything. The chances of getting two faulty devices in a row are pretty slim, especially since it records my running distances and heart rate perfectly. Almost all the reviews and forum posts I've read about this watch say the swim tracking is accurate so there has to be something I'm doing wrong.


The Garmin website says that distance can be innacurate for inexperienced swimmers, so that must be why it isn't working for me. I'm a pretty crappy swimmer, the furthest I've ever swam freestyle without stopping for a rest is 800m which took me 24 minutes and 17 seconds. And the fastest I can swim 50m is 1 minute and 9 seconds. I've been swimming once or twice a week for a few months. ( I also play ice hockey and run so I don't have a ton of time to practice, just took up swimming to mix up my exercise routine a bit.).


What can I change about my technique to make the Garmin more accurate?


I've already tried all of 
Garmin's suggestions
 Eg: setting correct pool length (50 meters), not stopping or changing stroke mid length, using intervals for rests, gliding after pushing off from for wall etc... Don't really know what else to try.


What do you guys suggest?",2017-06-17

7,Training Plans,"I got a 935 for Father's day. I'm disappointed with the training plans.


 First, they are very limited, not very many training plans.


 Second, swimming only shows up as a note on the calendar. 


Third, only runs are showing up on the 935. I kind of expected that the swims weren't going to show up (because they are notes on the calendar) but the scheduled bike time isn't showing up either.  


Fourth, I'm not receiving any type of notification when I'm not in the correct zone (during a scheduled run).


 Fifth, when I complete a training run, it's not indicated as such on the training calendar. It shows the scheduled run and a completed run but treats them as separate entities. 


Sixth, there is no flexibility. I can't choose to do tomorrow's run from the device. I don't think I can even shuffle my training schedule online and expect it to sync with my device after my next run. I don't think I can even view my training schedule from the 935.


Admittedly, I'm new to this device so perhaps I'm doing it all wrong. I'm really hoping that's the case and those who have been using Garmin training plans can straighten me out. So please tell me, how do you use your Garmin to train?",2017-06-18

2,Garmin 230 Pace Indication is Way Off,"So, this is my first post on the Garmin subreddit, and it comes out of a good bit of frustration with my Forerunner 230.


I purchased my Garmin Forerunner 230 last July to replace my ancient Forerunner 405, and for a long time I was very happy with it. To be fair, for the first month or so of ownership, the displayed mile pace would become very inaccurate when I would run underneath heavy tree cover, but that issue somehow soon cleared itself up. I had no further problems with that and could run in even heavy woods without issue.


As time went on, I continued to use the new watch nearly every day, taking it to college with me and running in various places across the East Coast of the U.S., all while enjoying the device's enhanced capabilities.


Over the past two months or so, however, I've encountered an issue that has become extremely irritating to a data-focused runner like myself. No matter what I do, on nearly every single run the mile pace indicated on the watch face will be slower than what I know I'm actually running. Now, it's no enormous difference; for example, the watch will say I'm running a 7:10 pace when I know for a fact that I'm pushing more like a 6:30, which I've backed up by wearing my old 405 at the same time. It's not the end of the world, but it's very annoying to someone like me who is a fiend for running data.


I called Garmin Support about the issue, and they said it might have been an issue with me not syncing the watch or updating its software regularly enough. In response, I began syncing and updating the watch via Garmin Connect several times per day. Although this vastly improved my GPS acquisition time, it did very little to help the pace issue. The watch still indicates way too slow of a pace, especially in the first half of my usual 10-ish mile runs. In fact, updating the watch has even caused it to once again become confused by even a small amount of tree cover, even just a couple trees lining the side of an open road. 


Weirdly, when we went to Switzerland for a week in May, I ran several times, and everything was as correct and working well as could be. It was awesome! Unfortunately, however, the issues returned as soon as I arrived back in the U.S.


Any help or advice in fixing this issue would be more than appreciated! As a complete data nerd and pace-focused runner, I'm tired of fighting with my watch on every single run. Thanks, and happy running!",2017-06-20

I've had an Edge 510 for a couple years. 2-3 months ago, I got towards the end of a ride, pressed the ""lap"" button, and when I looked at my unit a few minutes later, it was off. I thought maybe battery was dead, but it fired right back up, but I could tell that my bike/activity profiles were gone. The ride I was on, gone. My courses and some activities were still on it though. I was also getting a 2 hour difference in real time vs what time it showed. Dealt with Garmin, tried some troubleshooting, nothing worked, I got a refurbished unit from them.


Just a couple months later, and this replacement device has me ready to give up on Garmin. I have all software updated. Today, after a fairly hard ride, I was excited to look at my data. End of the ride I press stop, save ride, and it's not uploading via bluetooth. Odd, as this has been working correctly since I got it. Get home, plug it in, file won't upload to GC or Strava.

3,Garmin Vivoactive HR - Massive overestimation of calories,"Hi There


Last week I purchased a Garmin Vivoactive HR, and have been using it every day since aside from one day I forgot I'd purchased it.


Almost every day it massively overestimated the calories I've burned. Today for example I went to the gym for an hour. 30 minutes of running, 25 minutes of moderate cycling and 15 mintue assorted casual strength training. I'm a teacher anyway so with it being the summer it's not like I'm spending the day on my feet constantly walking or running about.


Somehow from today, my Vivoactive managed to figure out I have burned 1500 calories and walked 9 mile. I reckon I would feel it if I walked 9 miles at any point todau.


It seems to calculate my steps fairly accurately, and my heartbeat accurate enough, but it pulls these ridiculous calorie burned figures out of its arse, and it's extremely frustrating to see such inflated figured every day.


Is there a calibration I need to carry out on this watch, that I perhaps missed out when I binned the instructions along with everything else I foolishly thought I probably wouldn't need?

When I got my Garmin Vivosmart HR+, I sync'ed it to my wife's account first to test it (as I was testing another device at that time) - after which I then sync'ed it to my account &  used it for the night and found out that the sleep tracking wasn't working. The steps & all day heart rate weren't moving to my Garmin Connect as well. I can totally see those data in my watch/band. Using it for Run or Walk sync'ed the data through fine. It was frustrating!


I've tried a bunch of things: re-installed, reset the device, etc. and yet to no avail. Finally I realized that when I sync it to my wife's Garmin account - I didn't ""retire"" or ""remove"" it from hers. So I ""removed"" it from her account and since then my device has been sync'ed properly. Tonight I'll try sleep tracking and hopefully no issues this time!


Just to share - you never know if someone out there had faced this before & got stuck. I noticed someone in Reddit posted something like this 10 months ago via Vivoactive HR - but it's archived.. so thought I start a new one and let you guys know the solution!

5,Fenix 5 v 5x,"Hello everyone!


I've decided that I'm going to invest in a Fenix 5. I'm a collegiate outdoor professional but I would be using the multi sport functions, sleep tracking, and bio metric data more often than mapping. It would be an every day watch in the office, gym, and outside. I've never used digital mapping for any of my trips and I'm not an ultra light guy. 


If I'm not already using mapping, is there much of a reason to make the jump to the 5x? Is there a reason outside of mapping to get the 5x? Is the mapping that life changing? I'm concerned about the extra bulk as an every day watch as well as tracking sleep with the discomfort.


On another note, are there any outdoor people (specifically climbers) that have had an issue with not getting the sapphire edition? I know it's commonly thought of as not needed but that usually comes from the multi-sport community and I'm not as familiar with the outdoor perspective.

2,Fenix 5x and cals. This is long.,"I used to run quite a bit when I had the fenix 3. I always discarded Garmins calorie expenditure and relied on my fitness pal mainly for calorie suggestions. 


A year ago I was in a bad car accident. I have 6 bulging discs, 3 in my thoracic and 3 in my lumbar. I have 3 schmorle gnodes. Chronic pain, etc. I fear my running days are behind me, but I'm able to be more active again. Defiantly not doing p90x or insanity again, but active. I started Walking and I'll start swimming soon. Stay positive. 


This year I've gained about 15 to 20 lbs of fat I'd guess, also lost quite a bit of muscle so the scale only says I've gained about 10 lbs. I received a fenix 5x and getting motivated again. 


I wrote all that to ask if anyone trusts Garmins calorie calculation for daily cals burned or not. I'm hesitant. I'm shocked how many calories it is saying I'm burning.


I weigh 160lbs. Sense I've been exercising again I got my resting heart rate down to the 50s, and I don't usually go above 165. I've walked 14k steps today, and part of that was on a treadmill set at 12 incline with speeds about 3.2 mph. I burned almost 500 cals doing that for 45 minutes. Resting cals says 1635. I can accept resting cals because it's not crazy. I can accept work out cals being 500. But then on daily activity it is giving me over 700 active cals. 


I've been up sense 4am, walked to a corner store. Got to an air port and dealt with that hassle. Got home and cleaned like a mad man. I'm rambling. Either Garmin is in the ball park and I've been starving my body with 1600 to 1800 cals a day (burning over 3k a day) or Garmin is throwing cals at me.

1,GPS - any fixes? (Fenix 5),"I really wanted to like this watch, and I did... until I started using GPS. It has so many erratic jumps it doubled a recent walk of mine from what was 5miles to 10 miles, completely ruining most of the metrics it captured. Coming from an Apple Watch where I've used it for a couple years with similar routes, I never experienced this issue, so I'm surprised that this device, being specifically marketed for GPS, is practically unusable for that purpose, and the only thing I've found in response to this problem is an apologist video saying it's the best it can be for a consumer device, posted by a user who clearly hasn't used a Watch before for comparison.

I am hoping to ride up Haleakala in about a week. I'd love for this device to work well on that trip, as it is a major landmark in my cycling life and I want to record as much of it as possible.


I recalibrated the barometer using a youtube tutorial.

After calibration, the altimeter says I'm over 39,000'! ???


I don't know where to start here.


I read another thread here on these forums:


https://forums.garmin.com/forum/on-t...x-3-hr/144392-


They state that I can soak the watch in soapy water, calibrate it, or send it back to Garmin for a replacement. (Also lots of other things, it's 62 pages of forum posts, and I have no way of knowing if any of the information posted is good - there is literally too much to sift through there).

During the save it did the ""emergency shut down"". I thought no biggie, just charge it. It's not seeming to charge after a couple of hours. Thoughts on waking this thing up? I've tried a wall plug USB, an Anker Power pack and now a PC. I've had zero issues up to this point including great battery life.

1,Broken maps in garmin connect after switching to bing,"Hi,


I tried switching maps in Garmin Connect to Bing instead of Google and now they're completely broken. Tried sending email to their support but no response yet (probably due to time differences).


I can see in console that the Bing maps blow up because some error:


Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'visible' of undefined
    at Garmin.Map.Bing.MapProvider (VM18359 GarminBingMaps.js?17.12.0.1:82)


I need to plan a route, but the maps are broken - any tech saavy person that could help me with getting an api call to switch back to Google Maps? It's probably an api call to some sort of preferences stored in backend - perhaps someone here is better at reverse engineering backbone js apps :(",2017-08-14

1,Edge 520 Route Guidance is still a mess.....,"What gives Garmin?


I create a course using Garmin Connect (not being able to do this with a full screen map is a pain BTW), transfer to my Edge 520, turn on guidance in the 520, go to do my course....


I'm getting turn notifications all over the place, quite often not even in an intersection.... My Edge is telling me to turn left, and I'm riding a country road with farm fields all around me, not even a driveway!!! I set the speed on the route to 25kmh, and 20 minutes into a 55km route it says my vitual partner is finished the course. I don't even have virtual partner turned on!!!


Yet, courses created with Ride With GPS work great.

Of course you lose the functionality of the weather widget but you get to keep the smart notifications and the activity sync, which are the more useful features anyway.

7,Garmin Foot Pod vs 5.3 Fenix Treadmill Calibration,"I asked this a while back but it looks like they've actually released the Treadmill Calibration at this point and some improvements since the beta was released. 


Is the footpod still the best way to go when running on a treadmill hands down or does the Treadmill Calibration replace the need for the foot pod when using the Garmin Fenix 5 line? Just looking towards winter and running indoors, debating buying the footpod if it is at all any more accurate.


to quote Garmin:


> Added support for Treadmill Calibration. When saving a Treadmill running activity for the first time, you will be given the option to enter the distance that the treadmill recorded. This will improve the accuracy of the distance that the watch records during future treadmill activities. You can also choose to calibrate when saving any treadmill activity. When you are done with your activity, stop the timer, scroll down to 'Calibrate & Save.' Then, enter the distance that the treadmill recorded. For accuracy, these options become available when recording an activity longer than 1 mile or 1.5 kilometers.",2017-09-11

One thing I really loved that the fitbit did was once an hour it would remind me to get up and walk, since I work an office job where I can get zoned into my work for long periods of time this was super helpful in removing me from potato mode once an hour.

I changed the watch face to show the calories burn symbol and it says 2721 and I was trying to see where that number is coming from in the app. Is that number of actually calories burned or is it some estimate that it expects to be burned by the end of the day?


Also when I check snapshot it says 1207 Active Calories, but when I click that it says Resting Calories 1,149 + Active Calories 34 for a total of 1,183.


I have re-syncing and restarting both devices, but I don't understand why the numbers don't seem to match.


EDIT::


Images


EDIT:: Adding to the top.


I just figured it out, it was My Fitness Pal.


MFP changes the look of calorie tile from calories burned to calories remaining. Once I removed MFP it changed it back to showing calories burned.


I am not 100% sure about the active calories yet, but I did make adjustments to the calories burned in MFP and maybe that is reporting back in some way that screws that up.",2017-09-17
2,Fenix 5 elevation drift after update?,"I'm new to this subreddit, but I'm giving it a go since I'm starting to get frustrated.  


I've had the my Fenix 5 since june. Upgraded from a Fenix 3 non-HR.
When I first got it, I experienced quite a lot of elevation drift while not moving (upwards of 50-100m in a few hours) - an issue I didn't have with my F3.
However, it got updated quickly and seemed to fix the issue, and only drifted a few meters during an entire day at work.
Now, since 5.40, it's back to drifting - and just today, it drifted 40m during the night, while laying on my bedside table.
A few times it's even bumped my elevation from 200 to 900 m within minutes.  


I can't seem to find anyone else with a similar issue - so I'm asking here, as I'm getting tired of having to check and calibrate the altimeter several times a day to stay within reasonable elevations.

3,Thoughts on stress score usefulness and next steps?,"So my 935 just got the update and I've gotta say I love this feature. I had back to back short nights due to work deadlines and knew I was running a huge sleep deficit, but it was shocking to see Garmin say what a lot of the literature says about how long it takes the body to recover from not sleeping. Anyone who has had this feature for longer notice anything cool? Are the ""insights"" helpful?


Also, it feels like Garmin could combine this with a better sleep function and the recovery data to give you a ""performance condition"" of sorts in the morning. The pieces are all there, but like the non-beta connect app, it's not brought together in a user-friendly manner. What would you guys like to see?",2017-09-25

I'm not sure if it's because my running form. Has anyone encounter such big different? I use HRM4 for all my run,2017-09-26

FAQ




Where are the preview files located?




  By default - C:\Users&lt;Username>\AppData\Local\Garmin\VirbEdit\Preview




What are preview files?




  No idea. Anyone know?




Can I delete preview files? They take up a lot of space!




  I tested deleting preview files, and noticed no change in Virb Edit, you can still edit your clips. As far as I can tell preview files just bloat your C:/ drive.




Where is the ""GARMIN"" logo located?


Default installation directory: C:\Program Files (x86)\Garmin\VIRB Edit\Widgets\images\logos




Where is the default gauges artwork located?


Default: C:\Users&lt;username>\AppData\Roaming\Garmin\VIRB Edit\Telemetry
Downloaded: C:\Users&lt;username>\AppData\Roaming\Garmin\VIRB Edit\DownloadedOverlays




How to export/share or move gauge templates between users/computers?


Gauge templates can be found here, just copy/share what you need: C:\Users&lt;username>\AppData\Roaming\Garmin\VIRB Edit\Telemetry\Templates




G-Metrix data is not available for a clip, what do I do?






  Think of G-metrix as the third track: Video, Audio, and G-metrix. G-Metrix data has to be imported with the clip or added manually later. If you copy & paste the clip into the editor that will give you the audio & video but not g-metrix. For g-metrix you have to Import clips into Virb Edit. Or once you have the clip you can import it manually by finding the correct g-metrix file on your camera. If you deleted that file there is no way to get it back.




Virb Edit software stabilization is not available/grayed out, why?




  Not all video modes may support video stabilization. Additionally you may need G-metrix data imported to have stabilization available as u/curiosity_opfer points out below.




I cannot import new clips, the camera is connected and ON but the ""Import New"" button is grayed out and unclickable, what do I do?




The only reason I found for this is there is not enough space on the disk where the files will be imported to import them. You can check this by clicking &quot;Import Selection&quot; then selecting all the clips you wanted to select. At some point the import button will be grayed out and you should get a hover bubble over it saying &quot;There is not enough space in the Clip Library folder to import the selected clips&quot;. To solve this you need to make space on the your hard drive where you store your clips.



Media Foundation vs. Ffmpeg vs. DXVA?


Encoder (only affects export / sharing):


Media Foundation: Fast, lower quality. Cannot create videos bigger than 4GB on Windows 7, and cannot create videos larger than 1920x1080 or frame rates greater than 120fps. These constraints are caused by Microsoft, so they cannot be fixed by us.


Ffmpeg: Slow (extremely slow at higher quality settings), high quality. No file size or resolution constraints. Produces smaller files than Media Foundation.


Decoder (affects export/sharing and playback):


Media Foundation: (Fast over all performance, but low quality and can't read videos that are too big) Uses graphics hardware, but with lower quality (causes some color quality loss causing videos to look gray). Does not work with videos larger than 1080p. Uses lots of memory


Ffmpeg: (Very fast on PCs with decent CPUs) Higher quality with no resolution constraints. Uses less memory. CPU power is the limiting factor on speed. Fastest performance for PCs with newer CPUs, very very slow for machines with older or slower CPUs.


DXVA: (Really really fast on laptops / notebooks) Uses graphics hardware with comparable quality to ffmpeg. Extremely fast on laptops and other devices with integrated graphics hardware. Slower on machines with dedicated graphics cards. No constraints on resolution.


Summary
Over all, if you have a laptop, DXVA is likely your best option. For PC users, if you want high quality and don’t mind waiting, use Ffmpeg for everything. If you want your video faster, use Media Foundation for everything. Using the Media Foundation decoder and Ffmpeg encoder is a good compromise between quality and speed.",2017-09-30

I wasn't a huge fan of the 235, mainly because the hr sensor was uncomfortable -- I could never get used to the bulge. However, I really liked all of the data it provided, especially the heart rate zone and VO2max readings. If I remember correctly, the VO2max readings on the 235 recalculated with each workout. While I know that the VA3 also estimates VO2max, I've yet to figure out if it, like the 235, will recalculate VO2max automatically, after each workout. The manual is no help in this regard (and is actually no help in any regard, imo). Is automatic VO2max estimation possible on the VA3 or must owners move through the built-in VO2max test?

I came from an original Pebble and a Pebble Time Steel, both of which had much stronger vibrations.


The main reason I use a smart watch is to get notifications on my wrist, so it’s a bit of a bummer.

5,Vivoactive HR heart rate WAAAAAY off,"I've had my Vivoactive HR since Feb 2017, replacing a dead MS Band 2. I didn't pay too much attention to heart rate until later in the year when I tried using it with my Garmin Edge unit for cycling. Prior to the Vivoactive, I used a Garmin chest strap to send heart rate to the cycle computer. I figured it would be convenient to broadcast heart rate from the wrist, but when I tried it and actually began to look at the heart rates it was measuring, it seemed way off.


Like, when I was in situations where I knew my heart rate was well over 100, the Vivoactive was reading nonsense like 65 or 70 bpm. It didn't seem so much like it was reading low, but more like it just wasn't reading correctly at all.


I wear the garmin on my right wrist, with sensor on outside of the wrist, as they recommend. I've tried keeping the strap very tight, to no avail.


Also, just got a Peloton indoor cycle, and have paired it with my chest strap. As I ride, I can also check the vivoactive, and I get the same thing -- the heart rate being measured by it seems to have no relation to what the chest strap is picking up.


So, was just wondering if this is a typical issue with these devices. Do others get good HR readings from them? Should I contact Garmin for a replacement? Any other thoughts or advice?",2017-10-08

But then I had to change my phone and now it doesn't pair with the bracelet, it recognizes it the code matches but the progress bar loads at most 10% then the app tells me the pairing fails while the bracelet is still trying to pair. 


Bluetooth is on for my phone, the bracelet works ok in recognizing my steps, I'm keeping the bracelet on my arm and the phone centimeters away, I don't know what more to do.


As a aside even when I paired my bracelet to the old phone and could sync, it never did send the settings I set in the app (watchface etc) and a software update to the bracelet, I don't know if that has any relevance.


If anyone has any idea on what to try please tell me.


PS Got in touch with Garmin tech support apparently as the J3 is a newer phone it hadn't been tested and declared as compatible, which imho is a surprise as my old android phone is from a local brand they sure as hell didn't test for and it connected fine.

34,bought the new apple watch but returned it and went back to my fenix 3,"Thought some people may find this helpful.
&nbsp;
I got to admit, I got swayed by Apple's sleek animations and the premise of a ""computer on your wrist"". It wasn't however until I started using it on a daily basis that I started noticing which features I actually need and like (getting notifications) and which are superfluous gimmicks (most of the apps). This made me realise that the core 'smartwatch' functionality I use is identical to what I was used to on my Fenix 3 - getting notifications. There are some minor technical differences in implementation of course - the Apple Watch has a much nicer screen, however, it's not always on and requires me to wiggle my wrist to wake it or touch it. The apps are turned our to be very rudimentary and after playing with them few times, I never bothered to use them again - do we really need a bank app in a watch? or a messaging app that needs to be updated every time you open it? I'm not convinced. There was one thing however that I was still really looking forward to, that I had really high hopes for:   


Health and fitness. That turned out to be a disaster.
&nbsp;  


Heart Rate:




Poor sampling rate. I know that all new Garmins - F5, 935, Vivo 3, have a 24/7 1s sample rate. I expected the same from Apple Watch. Nope. HR is measured every 5-10 min. Disappointing.


Reliability - HR measurements when not on the wrist, initial HR readings immediately after putting the watch on being highly incorrect and take minute or two to stabilise - the problem is, those incorrect measurements are saved as well meaning youre getting bad data.
&nbsp;




Workouts:




Whats the point of ""rowing"" programme if it doesn't even record stroke rate or distance? or even let you edit it later?


Treadmill workouts being off by 20-30% with no ability to amend it


Zero workout screen data customisation


Tapping the screen to stop the workout with sweaty fingers doesn't work. 


No min HR, max HR, no zones, no recovery data


Lack of any kind of progress/achievement system - best times, best laps, best 5K, etc


No advanced metrics of any kind - stride, cadence, zones, running dynamics.


Garmin has been leveraging FirstBeat tech for years now providing tons of additional information, insights, and comparisons with thousands of other users. Apple Watch provides less data than the basic Forerunner 35.


Incredibly delicate product - got it scratched and dented on the 2nd day. My F3 has been through Scottish hell and looks brand new.


I also didn't realise that there's no option to see the health data on the computer or through the website.
&nbsp;




Pardon my rant. I'm just really disappointed. After reading articles about Apple's huge fitness studies, poaching top specialists from Nike, and ""the biggest update to watch ever"", i was really expecting little it more.

I thought I'm gonna miss the ability to play music during workouts without the phone, however I've already solved it by buying an old, tiny iPod Shuffle.

13,"Vivoactive 3, a huge dissapointment","I got my VA3 on thursday last week, and i have to vent about how dissapointed i am, and hopefully get answers to some questions i have that can help clearing up why it underperforms as much as it does.


Since thursday last week i have been using both my VAHR and VA3 on each their arm. I have used them exactly the same way, so there should be no settings affecting results.


The battery life of VA3 is supposed to be 1 day worse in smartwatch mode, and equal in GPS mode. What i have experienced is that the VA3 only last about half the time of the VAHR when doing the exact same actions the last few days. I read a post about restarting the watch after updating to 2.50, and i did, but its still a lot worse than VAHR.


The GPS on the VA3 is alot more inaccurate than the one in VAHR. I have used it for 8 sessions, and all of them show a significant higher count of errors in terms of misplacement, cutting corners etc on the VA3. The only example i can show to is a run on a curcuit, since the reader can here see where i were actually running.

https://imgur.com/a/4hjnd


I don't know if they will implement manual rounds to the VA3, but its a dealbreaker for me if they do not. I would go so far as to say i'd prefer the option of manual rounds over the option of preloaded sessions (which was one of the main reasons for my upgrade).


I understand the manual circuit may be added in a future firmware, but is there any hope for a fix for the GPS? 


And the battery life, so that it at least is equal to the difference in battery life they market between the VA3 an VAHR (1 day difference in smartwatch mode / equal in GPS mode)?


The only positive thing i can highlight about the VA3 is the design, and that the HR sensor feels more comfortable, and SLIGHTLY more accurate compared to my chest strap


IS it possible that my unit is faulty?


Thanks in advance for any answers that can help illuminating some of my reasons for dissapointment :)


I have 27 days left of my return policy on the watch, and will keep on comparing the two units. but i cant say i'm optimistic about keeping the VA3.


TLDR


The VA3 is a huge dissapointment to me, as it is a straight downgrade in a lot of critical factors compared to its predecessor; VAHR.",2017-10-22

How do you check/turn on/off the GPS on Garmin devices?

8,Fenix 5s six month anniversary: a love story.,"tl’dr: Six months in, I still love my 5S.


&nbsp;


The full monty:
After some decision anxiety about which model to pick, I bought a Fenix 5s this April. I posted some reasoning around my decision (
here
) as well as my pimping efforts (
here
) in the sub. Since it has now gone six months, I thought it proper to report back and tell you that I am still in love!


Unsurprisingly, I am no longer constantly checking Garmin Connect for my stats, etc, but the fact remains that it is immensely valuable in actual practice, sitting on my wrist for the full day, seven days a week. That says something in my book, since I am not normally a fan of weight on my wrist. (Consequently, my other watches the last decades or so have been resting on my desk at work and taken off in the hallway when I get home. But not this one.)


My main activities are running, walking and trekking, and now, having had it for the full summer, with all the running-walking-trekking that has entailed, I can only say that it is a true gem. The sports/health-related activities are so quick and easy to use that actually using them becomes second nature after a while (not like it was back in the ol’ iPhone-as-running-gadget days).


That part was not too surprising though. The big surprise for me has been how great the everyday-utility of the watch is. While I would not have bought it were it not for the sports applications, the reason I keep  it on all the time is the basic utility that is brings. Being able to immediately notice text messages and incoming phone calls has been surprisingly useful (especially since I often keep my phone on silent). Indeed, in general the fact that it is always on my wrist has made me use things that are harder to access than on my phone, like the timer and alarm clock.


All of this would not have been enough, I must however admit, if I did not like the look on my wrist. If the watch had  gone for the traditional gps watch look, i.e. 
Star Trek communicator
, I would never had gone for a watch in this price range. Now, it entered classic sports watch land (at least potentially), and with that I felt that I could motivate the price tag. With the ‘women model’ 5S, the Fenix series now could emulate the classic size of a men’s sports watch as well, 42 mm. To my aesthetic sensibility (given my small wrist), that was vital.


It looked good right off the bat, but to my joy the potential to ‘un-gps’ its look was very high. A watchband change and some watch face try-outs later, it gained 
the look that has remained ever since
.


In sum, while each individual aspect of activity trekking, daily utility and looks would not have been enough to make me keep it on my wrist at all times, in total it has collaborated into a watch that I am still fully in love with and that I constantly keep on my wrist. Let us hope that our love affair has a bright future still!",2017-10-25

Garmin’s acquisition of Delorme is still fairly recent; does anyone know if they plan to integrate things further?


For example, it would be nice if I could use the earthmate app with my Fenix 3 and it would make me consider the Fenix 5 if there was an easier way to plan routes on my phone.  So use my watch for wrist based navigation, but then be able to look at my phone when I want a bigger view. 


It’s also annoying that you need a separate Delorme account.  Hopefully they will integrate this into Garmin Connect.",2017-10-27
3,Fenix 3 HR versus Vivoactive 3,"Hi all,


I'm looking to upgrade my Android Wear watch as I'm looking for something more robust for fitness tracking.  I've been patiently waiting for the VA3 slate to appear for ordering ($329) and have found a refurb Fenix 3 HR for $342, so about the same price.  I've actually patiently been waiting for over a year for a decent fitness watch, but the VA3 is the first thing I've found that tends to fit my needs as none of Android Wear, Apple, or Fitbit have gotten their fitness chops together regarding HR and in-depth data.


I've spent A LOT of time here on Reddit, in the Garmin forums, reading DC Rainmaker reviews, etc., and I'm leaning toward the VA3, but I'm not sure if the Fenix gives anything the VA3 does not.


My general week includes 4 days of strength training, 3 days of a fairly intense tabata style boot camp class, and 3 days of running (800 repeats, 5 miles hills, 10 miles mostly flat).  I don't consider myself to be a ""runner,"" certainly not to the extent I'd order a Forerunner, and my understanding is the Fenix and VA3 are better for all around activities.  Feel free to correct me if I have that wrong.


I'm interested in the Garmins because I always want to have the HR and GPS there and available.  Currently, I have to take my phone for assisted GPS on runs and use a BT chest strap for HR.  I understand the optical HR is not the greatest for intervals, but I usually don't wear the strap for these, and I think the Garmins would be great for some of the steady state runs and give me at least something for the other activities.  I'm a data nut and am also interested in the all day HR tracking, fitness age, recovery, etc. that my current watch/Google Fit does not have.


I don't care about music.  I don't listen to it when running and haven't loaded a single song onto my watch in the 18 months I've owned it.  I have an app on my phone for lifting.  I do use my watch to record sets and timers, but it isn't a dealbreaker if Garmin's rep tracking is not perfect.  Regarding Garmin Pay, I have NFC on my phone and have used Android Pay twice anecdotally.  I simply don't go anywhere to buy anything without my phone and wallet.  Maybe that will change someday, but the lack of NFC in the Fenix is not a concern for me.


I had an all button input Pebble and a touchscreen Android Wear.  Both types of inputs have their advantages.  I suppose I prefer touchscreen, but it's not a wide margin of preference.


I'm leaning toward the VA3 because it can connect to peripherals with ANT+ and bluetooth, and I would still use the strap sometimes for precise HR data.  My understanding is the Fenix only has ANT+.  Also, the VA3 has the fast-swap bands.  I do change my bands frequently between a silicone for workouts and leather or metal for a nicer look at the office or going out.


So, what I'm really wondering is if the Fenix offers anything over and above the VA3 that I seem to be missing out on.  I just can't find much the Fenix does more than the VA3.


Appreciate any thoughts as I make a final decision.",2017-10-27

9,Vivoactive 3 Vs. Forerunner 735XT,"Hi guys,


So I've been debating between the 735XT and the VA3 for a while now and I'm still unsure on which to choose, so I was hoping you guys could help me make up my mind.


I've done some research and these are the thoughts I've gathered:


The 735XT seems to be able to do everything the VA3 does that I need it to do (e.g. running, cycling, etc), and is currently £20 cheaper for me compared to the VA3. 735XT also appears to have better passive battery life (11 days vs 7 days) and about the same in GPS. 


I'm also training for a triathlon but I don't really think the convenience of not having to stop for example my run to start my cycling leg when I'm training is that much of a deal breaker. In a race I don't think I'd be too bothered about that either since it realistically takes seconds. 


Garmin pay is a nice idea but I take my card/phone everywhere anyway so not really too concerned with that either.


On paper I'm looking at the 735XT but I'm getting this uneasy feeling buying a watch that's 1 year old when I could be buying a brand new one, so I guess what I'd like to know is whether or not the VA3 outclasses the 735XT in any other ways (besides looks) and if the 735XT would still be a good purchase even though it's a year old now.


Side note: I've seen various varying comments about the oHRM on the 735XT some saying that it records 24/7 but only every few minutes compared to the VA3's 24/7 at every second. Could anyone confirm this?


Thanks",2017-10-29

What is GPS mode ? Does that mean only tracking and not using some other advanced features like the ballistics calc ? All I need it to do is log my coords while moving, and then display my current speed and distance since last whatever (button press ? turning on ? unpausing ? ).  When I plug it into the computer I'd like it to download the data and then show me more advanced info like elevation gains and drops, altitutdes at certain points, etc. 


Will GPS mode do all that ?  if I turn it off when I'm not actively moving (sleeping, eating etc) and I'm only actively using it for 12 hours a day will one set of batteries last me a 3 or 4 days ? 


edit: I wouldn't be moving quickly, and it looks like ultratec mode would be fine for me (60 second polling intervals).  I'm sure that would make the battery last a lot longer.  I wonder if I'm using ultratec mode are there watches that could handle a couple days of 12 hours at a time ?

This is basically impossible and there is no way my desk job caused my heart rate to be so high.

7,fitbit vs. gramin? (looking for a smartwatch upgrade),"Background Info:
I have had a Fitbit charge HR for almost two years. I called in my warranty 9 months after purchase bc the band was pulling away from the screen. Got a new one for free. 12months later, the same thing is happing. There is no warranty on the replacement. -_-
So I am in the market for a new smartwatch and I'm completely torn between the Fitbit Ionic and the Garmin Vivoactive3.


I like that the Fitbit app holds all my fitness data in one place, more or less. However, it's not 100%. I have 2 years worth of data already on the Fitbit platform. I was using the calorie counting feature until it told me to only eat 500 Cals a day to lose 2lbs a week. Switched to using Loseit!. (Loseit! still syncs back to Fitbit but not vice versa)I have never the Fitbit exercise app to track my running correctly so I just use Runtastic Pro. Basically, I have been outgrowing my Fitbit's features but have not been able to find an all-encompassing replacement.


The Ionic and the Vivoative3 have almost the same features and they are the same price. (I am also open to other suggestions)


Wishlist




Track HR


See notifications (would like to be able to reply/answer calls though not 100% req)


Pause exercise - ex. when I'm stopped at the crosswalk during a run but don't want that the standing time counted towards total time.


Track Steps


Be a watch


Have 3+ days charge


Track Sleep


Waterproof ( I hate worrying about my watch when I run in the rain)




I'm a runner - working towards a marathon - but I also do a lot of walking, moderate cross train, occasionally hike and rarely bike.


I have been leaning towards the Ionic for days but the reviews keep me wavering. Though the reviews of the Vivoative3 are hit and miss as well.


I need your feedback! DO you own either of these watches? what do you like/dislike?

1,Fenix 5 (and similar) auto calibration Procedures?,"I wonder if anyone knows what automatic procedures, if any, garmin devices such as the Fenix 5 use for calibrating the measurements shown on the watch. For example, I find that the altimeter on my Fenix is often telling me that I am below sea level when I obviously am not, and when I am demonstratively very close to the sea it seldom gets that right. Since I often use the gps for running and walking, there should in theory be many, many opportunities for the watch to compare the gps data (which admittedly is not perfect either). But does the watch use the available gps data at all to calibrate?


Even more important than the altimeter is the step length, and so I wonder the same here. Now I know that the gps is not 100% here either, but it is still rather accurate (on my latest half-marathon, my watch recorded 21.65 km, and although it made me somewhat mad at the time, it is merely 2.6% off). So if the watch were to calibrate the step length from the gps data, I guess it would be fairly accurate even when you are not using the gps.",2017-11-10

I have tried all sorts of permutations of turning off both the phone, the watch (both hard button power off and menu power off), factory resets, bluetooth, uninstalling the Garmin Connect app and reinstalling and have not been able to successfully pair my phone to the VA3. The phone does find the VA3, but after a while it just says ""Pairing Failed"" (or something to that extent). I am sure the bluetooth is on for both the phone and the watch, otherwise the phone tells me to make sure the VA3 is on and nearby.


In addition to that, I have not been able to get a GPS. This one I'm not so sure as I have not tried it multiple times.


Has anyone have had this much trouble pairing their device after updating to version 2.6?


Update: Tried with another phone and I was able to pair it. Additionally, after trying a few more times if I am able to pair it via the general Bluetooth settings in my phone, but not in the Garmin Connect app. Also, went for a run and the GPS worked just fine. It seems the issue is with the app itself.


Update 2: I have been able to pair my device to Garmin Connect! After a few tries I was able to pair my Vivoactive 3 to my phone through the Bluetooth Settings page in my phone. That didn't make it show up in Garmin Connect. I restarted the phone and the pairing was still good. Opened Garmin Connect tried to pair my device and let it fail.

So is there a watch I could replace my vivofit with which uses wireless instead of bluetooth to sync ?


I understand bluetooth is used because it consumes a lot less power which is very important for a wearable, but honestly I'd rather change a lot more watch batteries than have to fight the bluetooth again.


What I would like:




step counter (I'm not into marathons performance etc)


wireless 


compatible with garmin connect app


a lower-end device would be nice I'm on a EE software developer salary


things like objectives, knowing when to automatically upgrade them like you walked 10k steps yesterday let's try 11K today would be nice


waterproof would be cool I also do some swimming but this is completely optional

6,Vivoactive 3 BT connection,I'm new to Garmin watches and also Android phones so I'm struggling a little with the adjustment coming from Apple products. I purchased the VA3 last week and I'm loving it so far but about half of the time when I open the connect app my watch is not connected to my phone and won't connect regardless of what I do. Most times the watch gradually connects on it's own but it's getting annoying when I finish a run and want to check my data but can't until my watch and phone (pixel 2) decide to play nice. Am I doing something wrong to cause this?,2017-12-02
4,Considering Vivoactive 3 as my first Smartwatch. Wondering how Notifications work/appear,"I've been pouring over reviews/articles and such trying to get a very good idea of what exactly this watch can and cannot do and something I am curious about is how notifications appear on the watch. 


I feel at this time I'd mainly use the feature to get ""Call/Text"" vibration/screen alerts. However i have trouble finding info on how detailed this is. 


Is it just ""X: blah blah blah"" in small text on the watch face? Can I look at each of my SMS conversations/history? Do the notifications take up the entire screen? That'd be better for me as my eyes are not the best.",2017-12-03
4,Should i return my new Fenix5?,"Hi, I just purchased fenix 5 (silver version with granite blue band) mostly for running day all day activity tracking. I don't do triathlons and other advanced stuff. I was looking for vivoactive 3, but they didn't look robust for me and I didn't want dated watch like 235 or 735xt).


The problem I have with fenix 5 is mostly related to daily wearing. I feel like watch is too heavy for my wrist and strap is either too tight or lossy. When it's lossy it usually touching pisiform bone and that's not comfortable at all :(


Should I return fenix 5 and wait for forerunner 645, which will have all running features from fenix 5 and onboard music as advantage in smaller form factor?


update:
 I can't return Fenix 5, there are only two solutions:




I can change Fenix 5 for FR 935


I can buy leather strap

5,VA3 Swimming issues,"I have been, for the most part, enjoying my Vivoactive 3. While it's not perfect, I do like the functionality of it. Since getting the watch I have used it swimming around 20 times and I have done a few different tests on the watch. I have 2 issues about the swimming exercise on the watch. These are the issues:


#1 Battery Life
#2 the Touch screen


Battery life is probably the biggest issue while swimming, but only for a few reasons. For example, if you go for a 90 minute swim you will lose approximately 30% battery life. That happens if you leave your backlight on. I currently run my backlight gesture ""off"" except for activities. However, after seeing the battery usage with the backlight on during activities with swimming, I now turn the backlight completely off before I swim, and now the battery usage went from 30% down to 5% for the same 90 minute time period. It's a pain to have to turn off the backlight every single time before I swim.


Now why does this happen? That's the second issue, the touchscreen. Any time water hits the touchscreen while swimming and having the backlight on during activities, the backlight will turn on. The other issue with the touchscreen while swimming is when your hands are wet and the watch is wet, the touchscreen does not work.


My suggestion for a solution for this is for the watch to automatically turn off the touch screen while doing the swimming exercise. The only time you need to use the touch screen is right before you start, while you set up the pool length. You save the activity by holding down the button. So if you turn off the touchscreen during the activity, it will help preserve battery life.",2017-12-04

After I save at the end of a run it almost instantly give a ""Failed"" sync notification. I can then open GC mobile and sync manually, but auto sync always fails. This happens even if I turn off my phone wifi before starting a run...figured going out of wifi range may have something to do with it, but no go.

2,Help me pick a Garmin Gps Watch,"Little bit of backstory, i've always been a bit heavy (6'2 208). I am looking to lose this weight and I have an interest in running, however I am a huge nerd and I love seeing my numbers and stats like my time, distance, time per said distance, I had my mind settled on a forerunner 235 but it's way too expensive for a high school student like me, the only think I need is an all day step goal (5000/10000 50%, on a giant wheel like on most of the forerunners), GPS+Glonass, all day distance, when i'm running I want distance, time, time per distance and the ability to upload to apps like strava, having connect iq (I think that's what it's called) to be able to get custom watch faces and stuff like that is always a huge plus. I don't need a HR monitor or the VO2 max or even the time prediction for the next race based on the last race or any fancy stuff like, I just need some basic statistics. I had a fitbit flex 2 and I really liked the achievements page on it because I get motivated by data and stuff like that, AI adjusted goals are super nice and motivating, i'm competitive so I like to beat these goals and numbers, but none of this is included in the run of the mill ones.

Recently bought the FR935, I train swimming (2-3x/week), running (2x/week) and olympic weightlifting (2-3x/week). I'm especially interested in the new training load and stress metrics that come with the FR 935.


I wear the watch normally day/night-round and also during my swims and runs, but cannot wear it during oly lifting training sessions. Hence I'm wondering how accurate these metrics might be in my case? If I simply enter my workout (reps and sets) on the phone app post-workout and put the watch back on then, will the training load metrics simply pick up this info together with my HR and still be able to predict an accurate recovery time?

I'm looking to buy my first fitness tracker and I'd love any thoughts/reviews of the vivomove HR if any of you have had hands-on experience with it.


The activity/sleep/HR tracking sounds nice and all but I also wanna be able to track my occasional runs and sync with strava. It's a shame there's no built-in GPS but definitely understandable. What I'd like to know is, how accurate/reliable is the accelerometer-based tracking? Has anyone compared it with GPS data? I wouldn't mind carrying my phone with me during a run but I hear that you can't tether GPS data from the phone. Is that true?


Any other comments on it would be greatly appreciated. I've been saving money for something decent for quite some time and I really don't wanna be disappointed.

3,"Multiple trackers, one user","I currently have a VivoFit 3 and I’ve just ordered a VivoMove HR. The Move will become my new daily replacing my traditional analogue watch for work suit and casual wear.


I use the Fit for sleep tracking, sport (because it can pair with a chest strap), and my more active second job.


I’ve noticed since I don’t carry the fit 24/7 that the sleep tracking is up the shit because it detects the time it spends sitting at home on my bedside table as sleep, then doesn’t detect sleep properly at night, and it’s basically a waste of time bothering to wear it to bed.


I’m also considering buying an Edge device for cycling.


Does anybody have recent experience using multiple trackers for different use cases? Will the Garmin ecosystem know what device is correct and only use that data, or will it be constantly mixing and merging data from both devices and basically all be a useless jumble? There’s no point getting around with $1000 worth of gear if I can get reliable/useable information out of it.",2017-12-25
2,"love my VA3, not having reported problems","I bought myself a new VA3 from Amazon for holiday gift, received Dec 21.


Many people have reported some problems they have with VA3:


Binding with Android


Short Battery Life


Reps or activities not recorded


Glitchy app or firmware


I think, from reading online like here:

https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2017/10/garmin-vivoactive-3-in-depth-review.html

and my own experience, Garmin have recently made big improvements to software.


Binding to my htc1 m8 (android 6.0 marshmallow) was smooth and without issues.  The app syncs (and resyncs, like after a run) to the VA3 quickly and seamlessly on Android.  As for Apple, I am a sane person, and therefore no longer use Apple products, so cannot comment. (Flame on, Hipsters! I gotcha covered ha ha. )


Battery life is longer than 3 days, that is the longest I go without charging, and it still has juice.  (This is without gps, see below.)  Also, full recharge requires only about 30 minutes.


Reps and activities do have some minor issues, but mostly work OK.  You have to set up your activities using the watch or the app, and touch start to begin counting.  (That's not on the face, it's the button.  That did cause me some confusion until I figured it out.)  Reps, like for lifting, seem to work fine usually, if you have set the correct activity.  Also, you can edit reps after each go, but I think you need to use the app for that, I'm not sure, which means you would need to keep your phone handy, inconvenient.


As for glitchy, the app works smoothly and syncs quickly, but there are some quirks.  The ""floors"" counter sometimes shows 6 up but only 2 down, or some such, so it is not reading correctly.  Also, during intimate activities with my girlfriend the ""steps"" counter increments really fast.  Having the ""GOAL ACHIEVED!"" screen appear, with a trophy icon and vibrating indicator, when this goal has not actually been achieved, can be distracting.  The Heart Rate indicator, however, seems to work very well.


The only major issue I have had is with GPS.  I have not been able to get GPS to work at all.  The on line reviews say the battery charge goes down fast while using gps, but I can't comment on that, because I can't get GPS to work at all.  So, to reiterate,  GPS does not work on my watch. At all. Ever.


I can say the compass widget works fine without GPS.


This watch looks great.  I got the black with slate hardware.  Another cool feature, well thought out, is that the band is standard 20mm watch band.  The stock black rubber watch band is great for exercise and workouts, but not really appropriate for more formal activities.  Guess what - No Problem!  It has a 20mm standard watch band so I will be down to the jewelers for a seiko or citizen band to wear for all the rock star and charity events I am constantly being pestered to attend.


To conclude, Garmin have listened to their customers and fixed most of the problems with their previously crappy software, and the hardware works pretty well too!  The heart rate monitor in particular is excellent. 


Overall, except for GPS, I am very pleased with this watch.  Most of the bad reviews are from before they fixed their software, so kudos to Garmin for listening to their customers.",2017-12-25

I've seen this topic covered a few other places on here, the forums, and a few articles, but so far none of those options have worked. I've tried the following:


Strava
 - it looks like it syncs workout data but not step count. I don't know if it actually works as I haven't gone for a run with the watch yet.


Fitness Syncer
 - it looks like it has the ability to take Garmin Connect data and send it to Google Fit, but in practice doesn't work. I've tried multiple times and messed with some settings but none of the data from Garmin Connect gets sent to Google Fit.


Endomodo
 - same with Strava, it doesn't appear to support Step Count.

 - started using this when I got the Va3 and it's great for sending calorie intake to both Google and Garmin, but it doesn't support step or other fitness data.


I liked using Google Fit as a central hub for my fitness data as I've previously used a Pebble which was wonderfully open. This was one of the (many) problems I had with FitBit too. I've given up on Garmin ever natively supporting Google Fit, but I'm open to other solutions.


Has anyone found a working service that connects to both apps? I'm thinking about returning my Va3 for a Gear Sport but if I could get this working I'd prefer to keep the Garmin because I like the hardware much better.",2017-12-28

4,Vivoactive 3 Newb Active Calorie Question,"Just got my VA3 for Xmas and am excited for it to help me on my way to getting fit.  I only had the opportunity to wear it at work (desk job) for a couple of days, but the active calorie count seems crazy.  I haven't done anything in the last few days but take a few walks to meet my step goals and to take a few laps up and down the stairs.  


I'm 5'10"" 198, mid 30's. Resting HR 64, high 142.  
943
 861 (see edit below) calories seems insane for 6700+ steps and 13 floors.  I understand some BMR is at play, but am I the only one who thinks this is way too high?  Plus, isn't the BMR already counted in the ""rested"" category?  I saw some other, older posts with similar complaints on other devices, but the firmware was updated a couple days ago (v2.8).  My height, weight, etc is programmed into both the app and on the web version of Garmin connect and my activity class is 0.  Do I just need to wear it more to get it calibrated, wear it in my sleep, or have they just still not fixed this?  Is it useless as a step counter or sedentary calorie tracker?  I'd like to know what I am already burning off so I know what progress to expect when counting my intake and subtracting my real exercise.  If that is hopeless, is there another tracker option better at this?  Thanks.  My apologies if I am beating up a dead horse, just want to know if I am off the mark or if I need to look at other devices while there is still time to return it.  (Screenshot below)

2 weeks ago I moved to the Fenix 3 HR and continue to use the same chest monitor strap when running.  I've been indoor track running and treadmill. Now however when running is spike at 171 then climb to 190s today on an easy 2 mile run (treadmill) it hit 220 bpm. It held here for about 5 min although my Lt is 169 and I was not out of breath or putting out any perceived effort.

sent

My arms are pretty hairy, so I’d wear my previous two devices on the underside of my wrist, but the Vivomove HR looks pretty silly if I’m not wearing it as it’s intended and kind of defeats the purpose of having the watch, as it’s difficult to read/use upside down.

This results in completely inaccurate run data and is generally annoying. My usual 10k lap has a climb of around 80m. It now shows an altitude gain of 50m and a loss of 250m but i arrive at the same starting location...


Automatic calibration on or off makes no difference. 


My crappy temp solution is to put the watch 5 minutes in the freezer before i start, then calibrate it again and then start running. However this will still be inaccurate.",2018-01-22

Is this still the case or can you take some control over what gets pushed through to the watch? It seems like this is something that could easily be updated in the app so I'm curious.

Multiple times daily I usually get out of the office and walk for about a mile where I also climb around 10 flights of stairs.  Most of this is done indoors, including the stair climb which is really the main part of it.

I just stumbled across a post that makes it seem like the ability to track stair climbing is useless because of wild inaccuracies.

3,Forerunner 235 wasn't syncing with latest version of Garmin Connect. Connect to PC fixed it.,"This might help someone, I hope, as I've seen a lot of posts on Reddit and Twitter about people having sync issues with Garmin products since the last app update on the 22nd of January 2018. 


Quick background, one of my dogs chewed my Vivoactive HR to death a few months ago. It always worked as expected but I took a while to replace and it but I purchased a FR235 on Amazon a week ago as it was £200 down from the list price of nearly £300. Great deal! So I get the watch and reinstall Garmin Connect app clean to my Android phone, but it won't sync properly. I think a lot of people have had this problem.


I read some fixes that helped a bit like disabling app overlay and re-pairing BlueTooth. But if I wanted a run or just the days stats to appear I had un-pair, re-pair and then it would sync once.


Now it occurred to me that I update the Garmin GPS head unit on my BMW R1200 motorcycle using my laptop and a PC version of Garmin Connect so I thought there might be something I could do there, so usb connected the FR235 to the laptop and fired up the Garmin Connect software. After logging in to Garmin with my account and getting the software to recognise the watch, it reported that the watch was up to date and everything was fine and the watch was running the latest version of firmware 7.60. I was a bit disappointed tbh as I was hoping for some great reveal. So I disconnected the watch.


Then the magic happened. The FR235 updated. To version 7.60 and now everything works!


I reconnected the watch and read through the error and sync logs. The version of firmware that the watch shipped with was 7.04. This wasn't able to accept the update file to upgrade the watch to version 7.60 which obviously works with the latest phone version of Garmin Connect released on the 22nd of January.


TL;DR if you're suffering from the sync issue post 22nd of January 2018, try installing the Garmin Connect app on a PC or Mac and update your device that way, circumventing the BT problem.

7,New VA3 Vivoactive 3 Owner -- Issues so far,"Hi gang -- I picked up a Garmin Vivoactive 3, and wanted to share some of my issues for the first few days.


Day 1:
First outdoor run. HR spiked above normal maximum for first ~5 min. came back down to normal after. Wondering if there is some calibration happening for first few runs.


Day 2:
Ant+ HR disconnected from Concept 2 rowing machine. HR was way too low (expected to be off, but making the note).


First Treadmill run, pace was off (to be expected before calibration).
For last 7 minutes of 20 minutes of treadmill run, the pace, cadence and heart rate remained completely static (despite me increasing TM rate steadily .1 MPH each minute until 20). Time and distance continued to move (meaning watch was not locked up)


Later, I deleted indoor rowing activity from connect. Uploaded TCX from concept2 logbook, which increased daily cals burned in connect. Cals burned never updated on watch despite several synchs.


Day 3: Went for outdoor run. First 15 min of run, my heart rate was 10-20 bpm too high (but consistent). After ~15 min, it dropped right down and stayed what I've come to know as accurate.


Overall:
Watch Face HR refresh rate is low. Digic face, updates approx once a minute. (read this is limitation of Garmin API to conserve battery).




So these are some of the things that bugged me. The biggest is heart rate during a run taking a long time to ""correct itself"". Should I expect this behavior to continue, or is it expected for first few activities? I've seen reviews that note the running HR is almost spot on to a chest strap. I haven't worn my Polar H7 simultaneously to compare, but I'm fairly certain the VA3 becomes accurate after some time during the running activites, but not right away, and I think taking 10-15 min to lock on is excessively long. Any thoughts? Thanks.",2018-02-06

I was running intervals, so different speeds throughout the run. By the end, my treadmill said I'd run 4.1 miles and the watch said 4.98 miles.


The treadmill is a used one and I went ahead and calibrated it (after the run) just in case.


Is it normal for the watch to be this off during an indoor run and is there anything I can do to make it more accurate?


ETA: After several runs outside, the distance my watch records now matches my treadmill pretty closely - .02 to .04 miles. Sometimes the treadmill is a little ahead, sometimes the watch is, depending on my speed.",2018-02-16

1,How to see workout results in Garmin Connect,"Hi everyone, I just got a Forerunner 235 and am in the process of deciding whether or not to keep it (vs my current Apple Watch). One of the things that really draws me to it is the workout feature-being able to program in a workout and having it prompt me at the appropriate times. However, I can’t seem to figure out how to view my results in the context of that workout after having done it. For instance this morning I programmed a workout for 3mi warmup, 5 mi at 10m/mi and 2 mi cooldown. I ran it and it prompted me perfectly and I finished the run. When I go into Garmin Connect I can see lap times but it’s doesn’t separate like the workout. I’d expect to also have avg pace warmup, avg pace for the 5, etc. I haven’t done an interval workout yet but if I did 4x800 for example I’d want to see pace separated into the 800 not mile averages. Do you have to manually press lap to get that info even if you programmed it in? Feeling lost with such a different system!",2018-02-18

2,Help Decoding Recovery advisor graphic,"I've looked high and low for documentation on this and hope the Reddit hive-mind can help. I understand how the Recovery Advisor works as far as the # of hours until full recovery. I've also seen on the FirstBeat site that they have a sort of zone system where level 1 means you can go whole hog, level 2 means you can work out but not push it too hard, etc.  I'm guessing these correspond somewhat to the yellow/green displays.


For reference, here is a 
series of pictures
 of a recent recovery. The first photo was snapped minutes after completing my ride. I have two questions:




The ring is dividing into 12 segments like a clock, but the intervals don't seem to correspond to hours. Does anybody know what these represent?




Does anybody know for sure how the yellow/green is coded? Given my series I'm guessing that any recovery < 24 hours is green, but I'd sure like to know more.

2,What do you use your device for?,"I bought a Vivosmart HR and after 5 months I am not really sure why I actually did.


The most important feature I was expecting to use was the move bar. However, the fact that not always when the ""move"" triggers I can actually walk, it sort of made me lose instant response every time I see it. Also, it's kind of annoying to get distracted while driving. ""Move""; sorry mate, I cannot leave my car in the middle of the highway and go for a walk.


Another one I was interested in: Smart alarm to wake up based on light sleep cycle. Disappointed to see this feature doesn't even exist. I used to have a much cheaper Jawbone UP2 which did an awesome work in this way. Anyway, my bad on buying the watch before checking specs.


Heart rate? I guess you have to be a hard/pro athlete to make this worth. Has this ever made some difference to you? I mean, ok, if I see my bpm are on 200 I know I will stop my activity not to die of a heart attack. Otherwise, I don't see a thing here.


So, for me it's basically a watch you have to charge every 5 days. And when I do, I may forget it plugged for hours which makes my step count for that day useless.


Waterproof? Maybe, but I prefer taking it off every time I clean dishes or have a shower. If not, my wrist keeps uncomfortably humid. And again, I forget to wear it immediately back to count steps accurately.

1,Vivosmart HR - Alarm issues (and suggested fix?),"Hi. This is my first post here, so be gentle :-)


I have a Vivosmart HR, which I also use as an alarm to get me up in the morning. However, more often than not (or liked), the alarm does not go off when it should. And therefore I've overslept a few times :-(


Today I noticed what caused this. The screen is so sensitive that if I in 
any
 way touch the screen when the alarm is supposed to go off, it will register as dismissal or snooze. For instance: If my arm is covered due to my head resting on it, or I turn over (maybe because of the alarm starting), it will be 
instantly
 dismissed.


As I see it there is a very easy solution to this, and one others (like Samsung Gear Fit) already has implemented:  Swipe up to dismiss and swipe down to snoose. 


Anyone know why this isn't implemented, or another workaround to the problem? Help is much appreciated, since I very much like my little gadget :-)",2018-03-07
7,Questions about rep counting on the Vivosmart 3,"Hello all, I just purchased my first Garmin fitness tracker, the vivosmart 3, and so far I’m pretty happy. I do primarily strength training, so I’m a fan of the rep counting, however I wanted to know if there’s anything more to get out of that feature, or if it’s just a gimmick. Is there any way to break it down into sets and reps for specific exercises. I had the rep counted on the whole time I was in the gym and just kept clicking start and stop every time I started and ended a new set. Is that how you’re supposed to use it? Also, is there anyway to cross check heart rate against what time you were performing a certain exercise? For example I’d like to know if my BPM sparked up when doing pull-ups compared to curls. 


Other than that, any more tips for just using the tracker in general? So far I seem to like it. Any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you!

I looked up the update and it seems to be from a few months ago, which I thought was weird, but didn't look into it at all.   


After the update, the battery life seems to be significantly worse than it used to be. Monday morning I went on a run. At the beginning of the run I had 1 bar on the battery left. At the end of the run (1 hr 10 minutes) it shut down from low battery. I used to be able to get a full run in without losing a bar.
I haven't ran since, but I fully charged it yesterday morning (Tuesday) and have worn it since without any running or activities, just daily wearing. It's down to half battery now (Wed midday). I used to be able to get at least a week out of it without needing to charge with no running or GPS tracking.

I always wondered why it stayed on anyway, turns out it was a bug. Since the last patch the sensor actually turns off and it shows a gap in the heart rate graph after a swimming workout. 


But why? The watch is clearly capable of measuring my heart rate while swimming. Even if its not accurate, its still interesting data to see.

I'm curious to see if any of you came from that platform and moved over to Garmin. I'm looking at getting a new activity tracker/fitness watch but one that has an HR monitor for all day HR tracking. I was looking at the Nokia one, but it seems to grab a heart rate reading only every 5-10 minutes, which doesn't seem all that useful overall. I'm looking at the Vivomove HR, VivoActive 3, or Fenix 5. I want to stick to the round watch face, and be able to give it a somewhat traditional analog look. I do like that all of these allow you to connect a chest strap HRM to it when doing workouts for more accurate tracking during that time, and using the optical built-in one for the rest of the time.


Will I still be able to use and sync my Withings scale in the Garmin ecosystem (willing to use a middle man app if needed), or would I have to enter my morning readings manually?
Also, I quite enjoy the sleep tracking and silent alarm for waking up. As part of this, I can give my watch a time 'window' to wake me up at an opportune time when I'm in a light sleep, rather than just waking me at one specific time. Do the Garmin devices I listed above have that feature as well?

10,Garmin Forerunner 645M crashed AGAIN (review vs the TomTom Runner 3 + HR + Music) (x-Post r/running),"Got my first running watch, the TomTom Runner 3 + HR + Music a year ago, and switched to the FR 645M a week ago. Was thinking of writing up a comparison anyway, and this crash has just given the impetus. Here are my headlines:




Switched a week ago and have run a fair bit since, so good feel for the watches


Functionally, there is no real difference between the 2 devices. If you are price sensitive I'd highly recommend the TomTom over the Garmin - it's great just feels a bit clunky in comparison




POSITIVES FOR THE GARMIN




The Garmin is more 'polished' and does have a great user experience when it actually works. I'd compare it to using a Mac vs PC, for general use. They basically do the same thing but you appreciate the small touches and build quality with a Mac


Garmin watch UX is fantastic and super intuitive


As a piece of hardware it feels really well-built, solid buttons and good weight


When auto-sync over Wi-Fi works, it's really seamless and the one actual benefit over the TomTom which can't do this


Garmin Connect is good and the workout design and upload is great, aside from you can't set auto-lap functionality within the workout on Garmin Connect




NEGATIVES FOR THE GARMIN


Auto-lapping during a work out. I'm just so confused


My interval sessions go warm up - time-based intervals w/ rest - cool down. I want km splits to display on the watch all the way through (or maybe restarting at beginning of each interval), but for the session overview on Strava I just want km splits for the warm up and cool down, and then average speed for the intervals / rests in chunks. I have no idea how to do this on the Garmin.


With the TomTom it just worked. If anyone could help here I'd be so grateful. But my point is a) you should be able to set this up in the workout on Garmin Connect b) it's really not intuitive - I have no idea what happens if I turn off auto-lap during a custom workout - will it tell me km splits?


It says that it turns off during a workout, but it didn't for me.


GPS on the Garmin is glitchy - have had a few randomly stupidly quick splits which haven't happened with the TomTom, plus the TomTom connected to GPS far quicker for me


And finally - the Garmin has crashed twice in the week when uploading to Wi-Fi


I'll come back after a session and it won't sync. Then if I look on the watch menu it will be stuck on 'sync in progress'. Then if I turn it off it won't turn on again. This is not a battery issue. Last time it took an hour for it to come back on again. The time was wrong but it was fine aside from that. It's currently switched off and not switching back on so will let you know how that goes... Tried to put a message on the Garmin forum but that's buggered too.


(Update - it turned back on after 2 hours of trying)


Any questions feel free to ask!


Edit


Another negative i forgot - wired connection to Garmin Express on the computer is totally hit and miss


You need to use a wired connection to add music to the device (if you're not using one of the streaming services it offers). To do this you need to use Garmin Express, which looks a bit clunky but is perfectly serviceable. More importantly - whether the watch actually connects is totally hit and miss. Of the 5 times or so I've tried to connect, it worked smoothly a couple but more often than not it's a 20-minute effort of plugging in, removing, turning off and on, hoping and wishing, then lo and behold it connects",2018-03-17

The Fenix 2 doesn't count steps, but since it knows my cadence it could calculate it based on that.


Anyway today the not-so-unusual situation happened that I ran a marathon with the Fenix 2, after finishing it I took on the FR 35, and a few minutes later I get a warning telling me to start moving. 


Fine, so it's just the watch. But then I go to Garmin Connect website. It tells me today I only did 6000 steps (which is too low). If you just do the basic math of time x cadence/min then you'll get I did around 40248 on the marathon alone.

2,Buy a Garmin Fenix 3HR or a 5X,"Hey everyone, I have been looking at getting a new watch and am trying to decide between the 3HR and the 5X. I have never had a smart watch before, I have been wearing the same cheap G Shock for years. 


I work out 5ish days a week, a mix between running, weight lifting, and high intensity circuit based stuff. I also like to cycle occasionally. I'm not an elite athlete by any means, but I would like to be able to track my metrics and see where I can improve. 


I definitely like the Saphire screen, my job is very physical and I would ideally like to wear the watch 24/7, including work. My current watch is beat up and has a scratch across the screen. 


I don't know if I should go the cheaper route and get the 3HR or just commit and get the 5X. The biggest pro I see for the 5X is the added data for workouts and also the maps. I do love to go hiking/backpacking and i usually go on a 3 or 4 day backpacking trip every year. 


How useful is the map feature though? Realistically I use a handheld Garmin GPS on my backcountry trips and my phone when I'm around time. I could see it being useful in an emergency if my phone dies or if I'm out running or biking, especially in an area I'm not familiar with. 


Mostly I'm the kind of guy who has the fear of missing out, I was dead set on the 3HR ubtil I started to see all of the features of the 5X. 


I wanted to get opinions from people who own both watches, is the 5X worth the price? Will I be disappointed if I get the 3HR? Size isn't a huge issue for me, but also if the 5X is so ungainly on my wrist that could be an issue.",2018-03-20

My main sports are surf, trail running and OCR. I'm interested mostly for running, although either option is waterproof so I will not have any issues using it while surfing.


Currently, in Amazon Spain these are the prices:




FR 235 219.99€




FR 735XT 299€




VA3 299€




Fenix 3 HR 324.99€






About the VA3, in Amazon it has very poor reviews compared to the 235 and 735XT, and I see many people complaining specially about the battery. Also, I read that the lack of hardware buttons make it harder to manage it  while running. However, it's the newer of the three, so I expect its support to be longer. Garmin Pay could be very good, but neither it's implemented yet in Spain nor I'm a customer of the only bank that will offer such service, so that's not a perk for me.


The FR 235 seems to be the rock solid option. Lot of good reviews, lot of users without issues, but... it's a bit dated, and I don't want to buy something that I'd have the feeling of needing to replace it in a year.


Finally, the FR 735XT, originally the most expensive of the 3 options but nowadays at the same price of the VA3, so maybe it's worth a shot.",2018-03-31

8,"Unable to connect to Garmin Connect or Garmin Express, customer support unresponsive.","Hello everyone,


I was given a 
Garmin vivomove HR
 as a gift about 2 weeks ago. Sadly, it wouldn't connect to my smartphone through Garmin Connect. After a bunch of trials, I called the customer service and a very nice person said that since they themselves just acquired an off brand chinese phone, they'd give it a try and in the meantime, they'd shoot me an email so I could send them all the technical infos. I never heard from that person again.


I sent a couple mails to through the support form, with all the steps I had taken and all the technical info, and never got any response from there either.


On my side, I did some research and found out that Huawei phones were having trouble connecting with Garmin watches, and I extrapolated that other lesser known chinese brands might have had the same problem. The software update 3.70 seemed to fix (partially?) this issue so I went on to try and update my watch (running 3.60). I paired the watch with my sister's phone without any issue (cheap Samsung phone) but it wouldn't update the watch.


I then tried to connect the watch to my computer directly through Garmin Express but it didn't even recognize that the watch was plugged in. So, starting to feel lost, I purchased an ANT+ USB thingy (which it turns out is useless for that purpose, $15 down the drain...). I then tried again to connect the watch to my computer through Garmin Express, and this time it did recognize it. However, I cannot connect to my Garmin account on Garmin Express because apparently ""servers are unavailable at the moment"" (this might not be the exact error message, but it wasn't much more detailed than that). And after a few trials, I never got any further.


So right now, I have this very nice looking $200 gift that's irritating my wrist and does little less that any $2 from aliexpress. I don't know where to turn to because the customer support seems to be ignoring me completely. And I don't know what else I can try on my side.


The usual things were done (rebooting phone / watch / computer, reinstalling software, reverting to factory settings...). 


Could someone help me figure this out?
Thank you.

2,[Help/Bug] Fenix3 HR defaulting to HR widget instead of Watchface,"I'm experiencing an incredibly annoying bug atm. I installed an app (GymGenius) on my Fenix3 and tried setting some favourite apps and all of a sudden the watch's default home screen is the HR widget, not the Watch Face. Wtf. Every time I push back on any widget or app (inlucding the watch face) it will bring me back to the HR widget. Even holding DOWN in any app will take me to the HR widget.


On a side note, when going into settings > widgets on the watch itself the HR widget isn't there anymore. Instead it will show me an entry for Watch Face at the very bottom. I'm not able to move it around though.


Any experience with this bug? It's incredibly annoying. Seems like a random installation process switched the HR widget and the Watch Face internally.


Btw I've tried reordering apps, reordering widgets (can't move Watch Face around...), uninstalling GymGenius, disabling the HR widget via the Android app (this makes the watch default to the next widget in the list lol). I kinda want to avoid a factory reset because of all the settings.",2018-04-09

My questions are, do I lose any metrics by pairing with the Polar H10 instead of the Garmin HRM? Garmin HRM-Run claims to be able to provide more running dynamics with their HRM.

2,best Watch for running/swimming?,"Good evening everyone


After not doing anything sport related for 3 years, last fall/winter I’ve started to run and swim regularly. Now I really want to buy a sport watch to track my workouts and progress.
So, what I want the watch to be able to do:
-	Track swimming (time, strokes, pool lengths)
-	Track running stats (well, every watch can do that so this shouldn’t be a problem)
-	Connecting the watch to my polar h10 (for running)


I’ve already spent some time researching some watches, but I’m not sure what to buy. I’m currently looking at 4 options:
1)	Garmin forerunner 935 (expensive and a little bit too big (I have a small wrist), seems very nice otherwise)
2)	Garmin forerunner 645 (expensive, not sure about swimming metrics and connecting to the h10)
3)	Spartan trainer (Good price, unfortunately the app has a VERY bad rating, so I’m not sure if I want to mess around with that…)

New to this sub but not new to running. I love it and enjoy pushing myself. Because I’m an Apple Nerd, I have spent the passed four years of competitive running (5ks, half marathons and marathons) using the Series 1 and Series 2. My series two just broke (still under warranty though), so it opened up a chance to get serious about a watch that will push me in other training. I would love to eventually get to an Ironman 140.6, but that’s probably two years away with raising young kids and all.

10,Strongly considering a Vivoactive HR. Owners - What's your experience been?,"I've had two Fitbit Charge HRs. First got one in June 2016 and replaced it under warranty May 2017. Now my second one is screwed up. Both times there have been issues with the face cracking - and I'm not hard on the devices. 


While it still tracks stuff for now, the build quality is pretty pathetic. The back of the display literally separates from the front. I'm sure I could superglue it or something, but I shouldn't have to.


Since I'm out of warranty, Fitbit gave me a coupon for 25&#37; off. Nice gesture, but I'm not sure I really want to give them more money. 


I've noticed that I can get a Vivoactive HR for about $150 on clearance. There's no way I can justify the Fenix or other high-end devices.


I mostly walk a lot, and I'm up and down a lot of flights of stairs during the day. Work day I can easily hit 25 on my Charge HR. Because I have garbage knees and have other issues, I do not run. I can walk forever but running makes me wish for the sweet release of death.


So questions:




How accurate are the steps on the Vivoactive HR?


How accurate are the flights of stairs?


How's the build quality? Can I expect it to last more than 10 months?


How is the app compared to Fitbit?


Can the display be turned off at night? My wife is a light sleeper and the light from my Charge HR can wake her up if I forget to turn off the ""raise to wake"" function.




I know the Vivosmart 3 covers lots of these features, but considering the clearance price of the Vivoactive HR I'm intrigued. But I don't wanna blow $150 if it won't be worth it.

I just finished a 30min run and streamed music until my BT earbuds died, about 12min in the run (totally threw off my pace, damn).


I was at 85% just before the run and I'm at 77% right now.


Here's a picture of my whatchface with the current battery indicator

I'm pretty happy with the battery duration after the last update. I must say ""good job Garmin""!",2018-04-28

I've been researching alot of smartwatch models and currently have narrowed my sights down to Huawei Watch 2, Samsung Gear Frontier, and the Garmin Fenix 3 HR and 735. My conundrum is what am I missing out when I get a Garmin vs a dedicated smart watch. And how outdated are the Fenix 3 HR and 735, should I hold off on a purchase to see if Garmin will release successors so I can get a better deal? Lastly, anyone else feel of the opinion that Garmin has a very ugly OS, as well as their mobile app is quite an eyesore? Just my opinion, wondering if the company will ever transition to creating a more pleasant OS. Also lastly, wondering how massive is the Fenix 3 HR?

So I put the watch on the treadmill and noticed it wasn't detecting vertical ratio and stride length, other metrics like cadence and GCT 'seemed' ok. 


I then put the watch on my wrist after nearly 1k and it then started reading back vertical ratio and cadence which is weird since I thought this strap was supposed to detect all these running dynamics?


I viewed the activity on Garmin connect and it appears it also didn't detect my pace until I actually started wearing the watch while running on the treadmill. 


So my question is, Is it possible to wear just the HRM run strap on the treadmill and just have the watch nearby to monitor or do you also have to wear the watch to get full running dynamics? I was under the impression the strap is supposed to record all these parameters?",2018-05-03

Has anyone else faced this? Is there a solution? If Garmin put the workouts in a frame that scrolled separately that would solve the problem, but I doubt they're going to implement this for me overnight :) . I can post a screenshot if anyone isn't sure what I'm talking about.

After, I go into the Connect App and I've got the right amount of reps because I've adjusted it, but every labelled workout is pretty much incorrect.. It's so tedious to change the name/weight in the Connect App especially when you've done like 24 sets and have to adjust each one. I think it would be a cool feature if it actually worked and I give props to Garmin because its pretty accurate when it comes to Push-ups and basic machinery gym equipment, but its near impossible to detect accuracy with dumbbell works and I can't really blame them. 


 I've come to the point where I just switch off the rep counter and just use it to record my workouts and monitor heart-rate, time taken and calories etc. What do you all do?

6,Strength training workaround,"I've seen conplaints about the strength mode and I agree that double tapping in between each set is tedious. When I'm lifting all I want is a decent HR measurement, time and rough estimate of calories. Reps is not something that interests me since I do mostly compound movements for low reps. If this sounds like you I have a workaround for you.


You need to create a strength workout and just add one workout step. I picked either squat or deadlift. When it asks you for the target type choose lap button press. This allows you to just press the button to start and stop the workout. I created 3 different workouts for the main movements.


I'm unable to change the first data field in the strength app but I made the 2nd one all about HR. It's only gonna record one long set so if you care about rep accuracy or rest time this isn't for you. This will just save you the time of constantly switching the activity type to strength in the app.

Thing is, I synced it to my phone (already have a FR235) and I got a warning about it being registered to another account. I figured it was obvious since it was an used device.

4,Wrist HR Monitor on Fenix 5,"Hi guys, I purchased my Fenix 5 a few months ago and love it. I wear it all day every day. The only thing I find curious is the wrist HR monitor. I run Spartan races and use the watch to help my track my training whether it’s lifting, running/trail running, indoor running, elliptical, etc. What I find curious is how low my watch is telling me my HR is during my workouts. It is usually fairly accurate during my outdoor running/ trail running, but it’s real low during weight lifting, elliptical, indoor running, etc. 


I know the wrist HR monitor is never 100% accurate, but it seems to be a lot lower then it should. For instance, it shows during an elliptical workout when I’m breathing hard that my HR is only 84-86 bpm, but when I check my HR on the elliptical machine it shows 140-150 bpm. Before I had the Fenix 5 I had the TomTom Spark. That wrist HR monitor matched fairly well with the elliptical machine bpm. 


I know people are going to say to get a HR strap but I feel it will just get in the way during other various activities. 


Is anyone else having these issues on their Fenix 5 or is this normal?

4,Vivoactive 3 real-world GPS battery life?,"I replaced my awful Fitbit Surge with a Vivoactive 3 a few weeks ago. So far so good, for the most part.


I know the specs claim 13 hours of battery life when using GPS, but all the discussion I've read says that's unrealistic. So what is realistic?


I just went on a 2h13m bike ride, starting at 100% battery and ending at 76%. Doing a simple linear extrapolation, that works out to 9h14m (2h13m = 133m. 133m / 24% = 554m = 9h14m). Is this realistic? I'm going to be doing some pretty long rides in the next couple of weeks so I'm curious about when I should expect to need to bring a charger with me in order to record long rides.


update: I just biked 4h25m, and my watch went from 100% down to 49%. That extrapolates out to 8h40m. So assuming the bottom half of the battery discharges at the same rate as the top half, somewhere between 8.5 and 9.5 hours of GPS time on a full charge seems realistic with my setup.",2018-05-20

4,Vivomove HR - Heart Rate Inaccuracy,"I recently purchased a Vivomove HR and so far really love the aesthetics and the functionality, however the heart rate monitor has been wildly inaccurate. I tested it last week on the elliptical, and my heart rate was averaging around 90 bpm, but using the hand grip HR sensor on the elliptical I was seeing a heart rate between 130-170 bpm (which seems accurate). I tested the accuracy again over the weekend, wearing my new Vivomove HR on one wrist and my old Vivosmart HR+ on the other for a bike ride. The results from the two were wildly different - the vivomove gave me an average of 80 bpm, and the vivoactive an average of 140 bpm. Considering I have tested my Vivosmart against other cadio equipment in the past and found the result to be relatively accurate, it leads me to believe that the Vivomove HR sensor is not working properly or just not as accurate. 


A few observations:




When on the ellitical, my heart rate was essentially at resting for most of the exercise, until I let my arm hang - then my heart rate shot up to what I felt was accurate. As soon as I grabbed the handles again, heart rate dropped. Could be the wrist orientation? Although this was never an issue with the Vivosmart and you wouldn't think should affect the device.




The second test was cycling, so again, the wrist angle could have been affecting the sensor's ability to detect HR, however the Vivosmart had no such issues.




I actually did a third test, going for a hike, where my heart rate average was 102 on the Vivomove and 119 on the Vivosmart, giving me a 500 calorie difference over the course of the hike - not an insignificant variance. So with a hanging wrist, the sensor was more accurate but still a good amount off from the vivosmart.




Software is up to date with version 3.70.






Has anyone else experience HR accuracy issues with the Vivomove HR? This could be a deal breaker for me, as heart rate is the only way to track a lot of my activities that are undetectable by steps (such as biking, or elliptical). I really love this device otherwise so I hope I can find an explanation or a solution.


Thanks for help!",2018-05-22

4,"Fenix 5 - GPS ""cutting corners"" on hikes/runs/etc even in open areas","I've been using the Fenix 5 since late January (replaced a suddenly dead vivoactive HR) and I've been impressed with its functionality and hard wearing exterior.

Plus I am a gumby so I've had many opportunities to scratch it) 


I have noticed however, that the GPS seems to ""cut corners"" on some of my hikes/trail runs. This is even in areas with clear vision of the sky (so not in canyons/thick tree cover/deep gullys) 


I will occasionally feel the watch buzz to tell me it has stopped tracking even when I am walking on a clear, wide forest management trail. 


Interestingly - it doesn't seem to lose any tracking or ""cut corners"" when I am mountain biking in the same area but under thick tree cover or in deep gullys. 


I've upgraded the firmware - still no improvement.

19,My experience switching from the Apple Watch S3 to the Garmin Fenix 5.,"Hey everyone,


I thought I'd share my thoughts and opinions since I made the switch from Apple Watch S3 (Nike, non-LTE) to my Garmin Fenix 5 (Non-sapphire) about two months ago for any of you people considering making the switch. I'd also love to hear all your thoughts too! I am just an average user who is not a fitness fanatic but I do like to train once a day adleast whether it is Gym, Running, Trail riding, basketball.


Pros of the Garmin Fenix 5 over the Apple Watch S3:






Aesthetics/Design
. My biggest gripe with the Apple watch was its design. I really dislike how ""'techy/nerdy' it can come off as, a bright square shining up on your wrist every moment, there is no circular option, there is no 'rugged' option. After breaking my S2 Apple watch because it dropped of my charger a metre high and shattered the screen was really annoying, imagine taking it to a job that is prone to smacking your watch (Tradesmen, mechanics, emergency workers etc).. Or if you are into sports like Mountain bike riding etc. For someone who wore a G-shock for this reason makes the Apple watch really hard to use as a daily. The Garmin Fenix 5 absolutely nails this, it is both rugged and circular, an optional size for people (5S, 5X and several other garmins for other wrist sizes) and it feels much more like a regular watch. I do not get anyone saying ""Oh neat, apple watch, what does it do?"" Which is what I want. That being said, I'm not saying that the Apple watch is ugly, It looks amazing on my partner and she really likes it and would never wear something like my Fenix 5.. I just like having the options that Garmin provide.


Watch faces.
 Adding on from the above point, the watch faces on the Apple watch were extremely infuriating, many of them are locked into you purchasing a specific model (Nike, Hermes), even the damn nike watch cost the same as a regular S3 but for some reason you cant get that face on the regular S3 (?????). There are a huge limitation in faces, it is locked down and not open to 3rd party developers like Garmin, Fitbit, Android, Tizen etc.. Majority of the faces do NOT match a square shape, they are very controlling with what you can put and where, and Apple's focus on disney characters is cute and all, but not everyone wants to rock 'cute' on their wrist. The watch face store on the Garmin is not perfect and there are a lot of BAD ones, but there are also plenty of great ones, I'm perfectly fine with the stock one as it shows everything I want exactly.


Always on display
.This is seriously underrated, it was awkward and annoying having to always raise my wrist on the Apple watch, something I think should be the first most important aspect of a watch after all. It is nice to just look down at my wrist and see the time.


More fitness options
. Obviously Garmin is the king of fitness and is the recommended ""go-to"" for people who take fitness very seriously. However, for an average user like my self I will just say that I was content with what Apple has to offer, so everything Garmin has to offer is just better. I like how there are a lot more sport options such as MTB, Strength where as on the Apple watch there isn't. Rep counting was cool while it lasted but I found it very gimmicky and un-useable. If you are a serious athlete then the Apple watch isn't even a question with what Garmin has to offer, however as a average user I am most probably limiting my Garmin Fenix 5's capabilities.


Quick-fit straps
. These are MUCH easier to switch and I much prefer this over pressing that little button on the Apple watch to switch out straps.


Battery life
. I'm not going to lie, I don't really care for the battery life as I take my watch off at night, and the sleeping option is great and I've tried it a few times but I find it quite uncomfortable to sleep with on at night. Although, for those who do want to track sleeping and want to charge their watch less, the Garmin Fenix 5 is king here as well.


Cross compatibility
. I like iPhones, but I also like Android phones and often switch back and fourth. Not being tied down to just iOS is a good feeling, my next phone can be anything I want and not have to worry about my watch supporting it or not.




Pros of the Apple Watch S3 over the Garmin Fenix 5:






The display
. It's brighter, the colours and OLED are just beautiful to look at, I still get jealous when I see my partners Apple watch. Automatic brightness is also really good on the AW. Once it gets pretty dark/dim you can barely see the time on the Fenix 5 without pressing the light button.


Software
. I really like the watch app over Garmins, I really like how I can change the faces and download apps directly through the app, using the IQ app store on Garmins or changing stock faces having to use through the buttons on the watch is silly.


Notifications
. I don't really care for notifications, but you do have much more control with what notifications can be previewed on the Apple watch (on iOS) as the Garmin app will NOT let you pick what notifcations/previews you can control  (Not on android though).


Price
. The Garmin Fenix 5 retails for $799 AUD, I happen to get it on a sale for $599 AUD, but even then the Apple watch S3 42mm retails for $499 AUD.


Wireless charging
. Yes it has inferior battery life but for someone who does not need the sleeping features it is easier to just throw it on the wireless charging dock.


Accessories
. Charging Dock? Yes, there are a MILLION accessories for bands/docks/cases/skins etc for the Apple watch. I've been lucky to find THREE alternative bands for my Fenix 5, no charging dock so far either.




A few points:




If I could go back in time, I would still pick my Garmin Fenix 5 as well - I just wish the display was brighter/crispier and that the Garmin app (on iOS adleast) would get a complete overhaul, it is clunky, slow and the IQ store is terrible to access through it. Let me do more customisations through the app rather then on my actual watch.


The Apple watch has a lot of ""Smart-watch"" features like ordering an Uber, using maps, texting/calling your friends.. But honestly, I've 
TRIED
 to use apps and features on the Apple watch. It feels like an absolute gimmick to me, it is so much easier to just pull out your phone and use that then trying to do things on a tiny screen on your wrist with one hand. For me (I would argue 90&#37; of smart watch users would agree with this too), all I use my watch for is three things.






Checking the time.


Glancing for quick info, (Weather, Notifications)


Fitness.






Going from a touch-screen to a button only watch also felt a bit slower, I would often just swipe and press on the apple watch where as now I have to use a set of different buttons for basic functions however, it does feel more simplistic and feels much more of a ""regular watch"" than a smart-watch which is what I actually wanted in the end.




I have yet to meet anyone with an Apple watch (outside of reddit) who actually uses it to call/text/order an uber etc. Yes, you can speak siri to your wrist, but I also did that with my phone (??). At the end of the day, I want a watch with an always on display, a rugged and circular shaped body, great for fitness tracking, lets me know when I have certain notifications or when someone is calling me, easily swaps out bands and thats about it. For me, the Garmin Fenix 5 absolutely nails all of those over the Apple watch (except for the screen and better phone app) and for others its the opposite, all this competition is just awesome for us consumers &gt;:) 


TLDR:
 I switched from Apple Watch S3 to Garmin Fenix 5. The Garmin definitely feels more of a regular/sport watch with a great rugged build/aesthetic while the Apple watch feels very techy and is loaded with a bunch of features (that I find useless personally) but I like the apple watch software/display much more.

I think my issue was that I forgot to lock the screen while taking a shower, and it misconfigured a few things (removed stress widget, changed watch face...), so probably, if I received a notification during the shower, it might have ""touched"" in block notifications from this app.

He wants one that he plans to wear all the time. He currently has a Fitbit charge 2 that he will be replacing and likes the real watch look like these I mentioned. Any of them will meet his coaches requirements. OH, he does use his Fitbit as his alarm clock to wake him up, he says it vibrating his wrist works better at waking him up! He also uses his phone stop watch to time his workouts like pushups for specific period of time and such like that. So if a watch could easily help him in some of these ways that would be great.


Are some easier to use than others? Do you guys have any advice on which watch would be best for him? I want to get something that can grow with him if he decides to get real into the details which is why I was moving from the 35 to the 235.

Since using it I have had nothing but trouble with it. My second and third rides on it lost GPS signal and ended up with corrupted time data. I have done about 25 rides with it since purchasing and have had issues with half of those. Issues include lost GPS signal, corrupt ride/time data and Strava segment ""drift"".


This is my first Garmin and I have never had a Garmin Connect account. HOWEVER, when I setup the device and paired with my phone, it showed a few rides in my Garmin Connect. One each from October and November. I recognize the routes and know those were not ridden by me. When I look at the ride info, it shows it was done with a Garmin Edge 520... but with the 12.30 firmware. When I first powered my device on after purchase, it had me update to 12.60 so I have never done a ride with that firmware. There are 3 rides in there dated on the day that I purchased the device. Only 1 of those are mine... In fact, one of those would have been impossible to have done that day as the trails were still closed here.


What am I getting at here... I believe I bought a used Garmin that was passed off as new. I also believe that this device may have been originally returned because of the same issues that I am experiencing.


It looks like the ride data was never removed from the device after it was returned. Does this make sense? I want to have my ducks in a row before going in as this is a shop I have done TONS of business with. I have purchased 4 bikes from here in 3 years and tons of other items. Also, would Garmin be able to give me more information if I got a hold of them to further confirm this?",2018-06-01

4,Garmin 645 Heart Rate not Syncing,"Good day everyone,


I let my battery on my Garmin 645 die and sit for while. When I recharged it, my phone wouldn't connect to it, so I removed  and re-added the device from the app.


After syncing a couple times it appears that all my data from using the watch over the last couple days has been uploaded - except for heart rate (also, the calendar doesn't show the events on that day visually, but the data for any activity is there if I click the day). My real time heart rate data is also not showing on the app when connected to the watch.


When I click through the watch, I can see my current heart rate and the last 4 hour data. 


Any thoughts on this issue? 


Thank you!


EDIT - removed and re-added the device once more to my app and now it works. Sorry, likely should of just re-done this step earlier.",2018-06-02

Coming from a Pebble2, Fitbit Versa, Amazfit Stratos and finally my 645 I’m finally happy to say I’ve found my Pebble 2 replacement. 
I have to say tho, as someone that’s never used a Garmin watch before, the menus are... erm... over whelming. Thankfully it’s something you get used to very quickly. Not so quick on the uptake tho, is that bleeding back button. My brain just doesn’t want to comprehend that the two left buttons are “Select” top and “Back” bottom. It is however great to not have a touch screen which makes the watch very useable in the shower as a music remote :) 
Battery life is good enough giving me about 4 days at 25% a day.
The smaller size has grown on me as I was getting used to the bigger Stratos. 

https://imgur.com/gallery/gSYQNCL

It’s also nice and bright compared to the Stratos but then the Stratos was able to dim it down at night. Anyone know how to dim the 645? Cause it is blinding if you wake at night and want to look at the time. 


Well just thought I’d give a few words on my 645 that I’m falling in love with.",2018-06-03

I loved it so I put it into my pack for an obstacle race where I was afraid it might get damaged. Someone stole it out of my bag so it wasn't my brightest idea ever. I got my renewed fitness subsidy from work so I'm ready to replace!


I liked my Fenix. It looked nice, wasn't too heavy in my opinion and had some really good features. However, I have also heard really good things about the Forerunner 935. I really want a fitness watch that has a good amount of features and is dependable. I'd like to use it in conjunction with my chest HR monitor (the Garmin HRM-Tri) to work on my running form so it would be great if it could track cadence, vertical oscillation, stride length, foot contact, etc. 


In terms of activities, I am training for obstacle course races, several marathons, and some ultra marathons. Would there be a tracker that is better for me?",2018-06-05

I am the owner of a Fenix 5 Sapphire and use it usually for running, swimming, bike.
Got a quick question though on the treadmill calibration:
Usually I would do three different treadmill exercises: (1) fast short run, (2) long slow runs and (3) incline walks.
Now what is happening, that after each workout I would need to calibrate using the watch, keying in the correct distance, whereas the next time I do one of above, the calibration is using the wrong calibration drivers (i.e. I am doing a fast run, next up I do a long run => distance is way off).
Is there any way to get this more organized? I.e. create multiple treadmill profiles and would that have no impact on calibration anyways?

1,VA3 Inaccurate Fitness Tracking,"Hi everyone, I bought a VA3 about 2 weeks ago because I wanted a good all-day fitness tracker that looked nicer than my Fitbit Charge 2. However, so far I've been disappointed with the seemingly inaccurate heart rate and fitness tracking capabilities. I compared my VA3 to my Charge 2 during two strength training sessions and one HIIT cardio workout (wearing one on each wrist for the duration of the workouts), and the VA3 didn't count as many steps or nearly as many calories burned as the Charge 2. This was despite following the recommendation of keeping the VA3 tight but not constricting during workouts.


My question is two-fold:




is there a way to improve the fitness tracking of the VA3? For example, does it just need more data from my workouts to track them more accurately, or do I need to tweak a setting?




am I just putting too much stock in the accuracy of my Charge 2? I have a tough time believing it since it's consistently rated as one of the best, and my VA3 said I only burned 250ish calories during a 90 minute intense workout, but I'm interested to hear about other experiences and thoughts",2018-06-13

5,If not while sleeping then when do you charge your Watch?,"I'd love to monitor my sleep with the new ""Advanced"" sleep tracking of my FR645M but that requires the watch be on my wrist while I sleep, the time I normally charge the watch. For those of you who wear it to bed when in the world do you charge it? I'm on the go all day and wear the watch to keep my phone notifications visible...I don't want to be without it for a few hours while it charges, hence why I do so while asleep.

1,Garmin Training Load not working properly for me,"So I have a FR935, I use HRM strap for my exercises and my trainings show up in garmin with HR data.


But for some reason my indoor bicycle workouts don't count for the training load (sitting currently at 0 because last two weeks only done indoor training).

Is this because I don't track the workout on garmin, but on TrainerRoad, which then uploads the data to Garmin?

2,Garmin FR 935 APAC vs ROW,"I am looking to buy a Garmin FR935 - now there are the 2 versions - Asian (APAC) and Rest of the World (ROW). The Asian is approx 70€ cheaper. So the question is, what is the difference?


I have found that the languages are Asian and English on the APAC and then all kinds of languages on the RAW. English is fine, so no problem there.


APAC gets updates later - how critical is that? My current Garmin is a FR305 - so my last update has been ages ago...


And then I found somebody stating that the hardware might be different as well. Now this is the interesting part. Anybody here with more details on that?


The question is, if the APAC will cause problems for me in Europe that could prevent me from buying teh 70€ cheaper APAC version.

3,Slow notifications on Vivoactive 3?,"Have had my Vivoactive 3 for three days, I'm using Connect on Android. Email notifications are sometimes taking a full minute to reach the watch from my phone (when they are right next to each other). Phone calls are detected in 8-9 seconds which is also slow- in normal situations I wouldn't even have time to get my phone out of my handbag before it goes to voicemail. My main reason for wanting a watch with notifications is that it's impossible to hear my phone ringing when I'm out in a busy place and am carrying my phone in my handbag so this is possibly a dealbreaker.


I have my old Vivosmart 3 sitting on my desk waiting for the charge to die as there's no way to turn it off, and its notifications arrive less than a second after they are sent. Is it possible at all that the delay is because Connect is sending notifications to two devices? Is there another fixable problem? Or is this just normal behaviour for the VA3?",2018-06-15

2,Garmin Calorie Count (Daily),"I recently switched from a Fitbit Ionic to a Garmin VA3. I've noticed a big difference in how each calculates my daily calorie burn and I was curious as to why.


Here's what I mean: I usually get at least 10,000 steps a day if not more in general movement and deliberate walking. Fitbit would say I had earned more calories than Garmin does. As an example, about a month ago, I walked about 12,000 steps. Fitbit calculated my day at 2400 calories. Yesterday, I walked 15,000 and the Garmin calculated my day at 2144.

7,Should I buy the Vivoactive 3??,"have been using Fitbit since the Flex. Evenually I got a Surge and I have kept it ever since. 


I bought an Ionic because it seemed like the natural progression. I am not thrilled with it. I don't like the options and the interface. There are a number of things I don't like. The watch not being on for example. I don't like the wrist action or pushing a button to see the time. I don't like that when I start an exercise the screen will time out. I can hit the left button to see the screen, but I can't hit the button again to close it. I have to wait for it to time out. I don't like that the green HR monitor is always flashing even though I shut off the HR monitor. They are little nitpicky things.


Now I am torn. Since I don't like the Ionic that much for the price, should I go for a Garmin Vivoactive 3? 


What about a Samsung Gear 3? 


Or do I just say screw it and go back to a Surge even though they are discontinued? The Garmin Fenix looks interesting, but it out of my price range for the most part.


What I read about the Vivoactive intrigues me and makes me think that is the one for me. Can you please help me decide?

3,Fenix 5 Plus vs 5X first thoughts - AMA,"I received my 5 plus yesterday and after playing it for less than a day here are my thoughts compared to the 5X it is replacing.


First impressions:




It (5+) feels a lot smaller than the dimensions indicate.  Although the display is the same size, it looked smaller because of the smaller bezel.  For a couple of activities I wore both watches, one on each wrist.  The 5x was moved to my off-wrist, and felt so much clunker (probably due to both size and unfamiliarity with the watch on that side).  




The band feels cheaper. The band is narrower, thinner, and smoother than the 5x band.




The buttons feel different.  There is 0.5mm to 1mm of travel before you actually start push the button where there is a tactile ""click"" when you get to the button (after the free travel part).   It is hard to describe, but it almost feels like a two stage button.  I don't like it. They did have to re-design the buttons for the Descent Mk1 scuba diving variant of the 5X, so they might be using that new design.  The 5x buttons would stick at depth due to the pressure.  This may be (I hope) why they feel different.






Functionality:




The default hot keys changed.  Long pressing the ""down"" button now brings you to Music instead of back to the clock/home.  




There are a lot more options for units.  On the 5x you could select which units you wanted for distance separate from the overall units used.  With the 5+ there are many more options.  I really appreciate this since I use an odd mix of metric and imperial.  You can individually set: Distance, Pace, Elevation, Depth, Weight, Height, Temperature, Pressure, and Vert Speed.  I love that Depth can be set to different units than height.  But, since it's not a diving watch, I can't really take advantage of that feature.




Some of the data screens I use (DozenRun specifically) shows as not compatible with the 5+, but works fine on the 5x.






Accuracy:




I did a short run last night (just over 2 miles).  The 5x was set to use GPS and GLONASS and the 5+ was set to use GPS and GALILEO.  Results were about the same.  Both were started and ended together, 5x had a distance of 2.06 vs 2.08 for the 5+.  Looking at the details both were off at different points (showing me running through houses vs on the road).  Neither was consistently off so the pluses and minuses tended to average out.  In general it looked like both under reported distance since they showed more corner cutting (just on different corners).




[Edited to add] I also used it at the gym with my strength training.  The automatic rep counter on the 5+ seems to be less accurate than the 5x.  Neither were accurate.  I would need to correct the rep counter about 20% of the time on the 5x, but on the 5+ corrections were needed at least 50% of the time.  Most of the time it over counted reps, but not always.  Exercises where I used the rep counter and it should have been more accurate were shoulder press and dead lifts.






Summary.  In general I like the 5+ better.  It is not better on every single dimension, but it definitely adds far more than it takes away.  If I were comparing the 5X MSRP price vs the 5+, I would absolutely recommend the 5+.  Once the 5x starts getting discounted more, it will become a much harder choice.

1,Calorie Calculation Differences,"Over the past several weeks, I have had the opportunity to use and compare a Fenix 5x, 5+, and 5+ Titanium.  I expected there to be slight differences based on GPS and heart rate measurement differences.  On my last test run, I found differences I couldn't explain.  One watch showed significantly higher calories burned (667 vs 579) for the exact same run.


Here is the setup.


Watch 1: 5+ Sapphire


Watch 2: 5+ Titanium Sapphire


Both watches were connected to an HRM-Tri so the heart rate data was identical.  I went on a 4 mile low speed jog and there was a 2 second discrepancy between the two watches based on user error of my attempt to start and stop them at the same time.  2 seconds  shouldn't make much of a difference.


Watch 1 (regular): 


Distance measured: 4.20mi 


Calories consumed: 579


Watch 2 (titanium):


Distance measured: 4.16mi


Calories consumed: 667


Both watches were tied to the same profile (used my same weight and height) and both used the same heart rate data.  How could the titanium watch calculate significantly higher calories given it was working of a marginally lower speed?",2018-07-02

Running is the only activity I care to seriously track (although I do hike and ski), so in general the Fenix is 
way
 overkill.... except that the support for true maps is really tempting me. I've tried dwMaps on the 645 and while ""background maps"" exist now, it seems like a poor substitute.


I tend to go on runs with a destination or distance in mind but not always an exact course planned, and today I occasionally find myself pulling out my phone to get myself out of dead ends and such. It seems like the 5+ would be super awesome here.


That said, paying an additional $250+ for the Fenix over the 645 seems a bit crazy purely for the maps feature. I have a fitness gear benefit from work that's making me less price-averse, but it's still cash that could go towards other gear.


So... how are you enjoying maps on your 5+ while running? Useful? Too small or cumbersome? Do you find yourself still pulling out your phone anyways?",2018-07-04

My Polar m400 allows me to set different profiles (so the display is configurable dependent on what I am doing) for each activity and am looking for a Garmin with similar capabilities.


I guess I'm comparing the Garmins between the 235, 645, 735xt, 935, vivo 3 or HR, and the fenix 5.


From what I've seen the 235 is a bit basic and the 935 is aimed at triathletes - but I have no intention of swimming so not needing the superb water recordings.  Also not needing music on the watch

8,fenix 5 series: HR failures,"Hi, I am struggling with a incomprehensible and not replicable error that occours througout the whole Fenix series:  


HR reading failures after a certain amount of time.
 


This graph was done from todays morning walk.




green line is a Polar H10 chest belt for reference.


violet line is the new Fenix 5+ (got it yesterday)


blue is my 2 months old Fenix 5X (has same symptoms, but not today)




This was a easy walk with my dog, minute 25-33 we had a break, resting on a bench, but the error started around minute 50
until the end of the walk.  


The HR reading of Fenix 5+ broke down to around 55 bpm,
 where the correct one would have been around 100-110, as recorded
with the Polar H10 and Fenix 5X, see yourself:  


https://preview.redd.it/5uzgpi14k4811.jpg?width=738&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=517aee0614a64947ca69198b3819b5b307cde102


This very same error already happened on 3 other Fenix watches, that I owned before since February of this year.
A Fenix 5, and two 5X's, now the same on the new 5+. I really hoped that this annoying bug is fixed on the new 5+ series.
But NO, it obviously is not.  


These wrong readings happened on all Fenix watches I owned. I replaced them all within 30 days, but every replacement
showed the same symtoms after some time.   


I tried many things:




cleaning the watch in water before and after every session


wearing it on the other arm


wearing it upside down


resetting it




Nothing helped. The error happens again and again. But not replicable. Sometimes the watch gives correct HR readings, most times
it doesn't.  


And we are not talking about a 10&#37; inaccuracy, that would be tolerable, but about 50+&#37;.  


I have contacted Garmin Germany support a few times already. They say they are not aware of this problem and nobody else
reported this to them. One of the support staff members said the device is faulty and needs to be replaced. I did this then, but
the error reappared on the replacement as well.
So Garmin was not of any help for now.  


I was thinking that maybe it has to do with some static load on my skin, depending on what I wear, but also this is not
reproducable. Maybe with high humidity (I am at sea lvl, with very high humidity most of the time). But even cleaning it
when the HR reading is so low doesn't change a thing.  


so my questions are:




has anybody of you run into this failures of the HR sensor?


how can I track this down, so that it becomes reproducable?


why isn't Garmin interested to get this fixed?


why is it only me that notice this?




These watches are expensive and top notch, but with a HR sensor that gives wrong readings on near every walk/hike
really really is not acceptable. All the statistics are wrong,
I understand perfectly that a arm worn HR sensor on a watch is never as accurate as chest worn one, but still it should
work nicely within a certain range of tolerance. Not in my case and experience with 4 different Fenix 5 models.  


What are your suggestions?",2018-07-05

I found out afterwards that this doesn't seem to be uncommon; apparently this advertised-as-waterproof watch is anything but. Plenty of reports of watches that failed when they went underwater.


I'm pretty certain the watch is outside of warranty. This stinks.


After giving it time to dry I've connected it to a charger, with a USB power meter to tell me how much current it's pulling. For the first few times I tried this it seemed to be improving, but now it seems to be just doing the same thing. It generally comes up with a charging icon, pulls 200mA, vibrates a couple times, gives the Garmin logo, goes black, then either just stays black (and power use goes to 0) or repeats the vibrate-logo-black cycle. When its power use goes to 0 - either by itself or because I pulled it off the charger - it takes time before it'll draw any current again.


Some people on Garmin fora claimed that attaching, charging, detaching, repeat >50x managed to charge and revive their Vivoactive HRs. I'm not confident that's working for mine, though I haven't been counting. I'd bet that the 'it won't take any charge at all, leave it alone a while and try again' is draining what power is left so it's starting from zero power each time it draws any current.

I then got the Fenix 5X Plus just a few days ago, updated the software on Garmin Connect, went through the settings and made sure Physio TrueUp was enabled. However, whilst it would reflect my VO2Max from Connect, it was not showing me training status and was still telling me I needed to use the watch for more than a week to get training status, etc.


I browsed Reddit, looking for a clue. Nothing. Then I browsed the Garmin forums. I found a comment on one thread in the middle of the posts that said they had to enable Physio TrueUp from Garmin Connect as a well, under the device settings. Turns out even though the Fenix 5X Plus has Physio TrueUp enabled and it has synced multiple times that this setting wasn't enabled/mirrored in Garmin Connect.


I enabled it from Connect for my Fenix 5X Plus and it has worked well since.

The problem isn't just about a bug, is the fact that during the activity is difficult to keep track in mind if I should run or if I should walk.

Underneath swimming, it says indoor auto-pause feature, none of the watches have it, however, 645/935 explicitly state that they will show rest time afterwards while the va3 just says no.

Will the vivoactive 3 show rest times for workouts automatically?


Does this tracking of rest periods work on other sports? I'm primarily a canoe paddler and weightlifter so I'm looking to track strength training, running, and paddling.

1,Is elevation data from GPS possible on non barometric Garmins?,"If a Garmin lack a barometric sensor, will it still record elevation Changes if I use any of the preset GPS activities like Run and Bike?


For instance, the golf Watch Approach S60 lacks both a heart rate sensor and a barometric sensor. However, its compatible with HRM bands, so still possible to get heart rate. But how about elevation, will it record elevation as long as im using any of the GPS Active workouts or Does it take a barometric sensor for that?",2018-07-15

4,How does Garmin calculate the active calories ?,"My active calories calculated by Garmin seem a bit too high and not very consistent.


For example, my activities for today were as follows:




Ran 5k -> 456cal (reported by the watch)


Walked 4.57k (Watch recorded a total distance of 9.57k)


40 minutes of moderate strength training




The watch doesn’t say how many calories I burned from walking alone. We can get an idea of how much someone of my weight and walking pace (11min/km) would burn walking 1 km from this 
site
. Let's be generous and assume I walked over a surface with a 2% incline throughout; this assumption is not far-fetched as I was walking mostly on a flat road with little to no undulations. The website says a person of my size would burn 86 cal per km. This seems too high given I burned only 456cal in my 5k run (91.2cal/km), but let’s still use it I’m trying to find the maximum possible value I can get from all my activities. This means I would burn a total of 4.57 * 86cal/km = 393calories. 


The last activity left is about 40 minutes of moderate strength training. A couple of leg presses here, a couple of lat pull downs there. We're talking here about 80lbs at most in most of these. There's no way I can guess how much calorie I could have burned from these activities because I don’t use my Fenix 3 HR strength training activities. The only thing the 3 HR was doing is measure my HR. So, the 3 HR doesn't know I'm lifting or what weights I'm using. I've always heard that weight training doesn't burn that much calories. This 
website
 confirms that and claims that a 30 minute moderate workout burns around 150 calories for someone of my weight. So, 40 minutes would be 200 calories.


If we now add everything, we end up with 356+393+200=1049. We still have to remember that the watch has no idea I'm doing any strength training activity during this time. Now, the watch says I burned 1,349calories. We know for certain where 456 calories came from. We generously estimated the calories burned from walking and strength training. This still leaves us with 300 calories unaccounted for. In other words, the watch is overestimating my calories burned by over 28%.


How do your experiences compare to mine ?


Edit: I did a 10k run today (958cal) and a 4.4k walk (378cal, calculated using the method above). I did a couple of crunches and leg raises, so let's generously assume 100cal. That's a total of 1,436. The watch reports 1,844. Surprisingly, that's an overestimation of 28.5%. At this point, I feel safe to multiply all my active calories by 0.72 for more accurate estimates.",2018-07-16
2,VA3 watch - best for swimming?,"Hello everyone


I'm a bit of a newbie at activity tracking. I bought my first activity tracker a bit over a year ago. It's the TomTom Spark/Cardio 3. I didn't know what to get and all the experiences I read about on the internet confused me even more as to which brand and which kind of watch... So I simply got the TomTom because it's what the guy from the electronics store, who told me he was an avid sportsman, recommended -- and one of my friends already had one and she seemed pretty happy with it. Now, I'm not entirely unhappy with my watch. It does its job pretty okay. I swim a lot and it counts the lengths, distance, etc rather well. However, when I hit the gym, I feel like the heart rate tracker isn't always on point. (Pretty far off sometimes actually.)


Now, as of tonight, on a Dutch discount website, they are selling the Garmin vívoactive 3 for €199,95 and a refurbished (by Garmin) fenix 3 Sapphire for €222.


I've been considering buying one of them. After reading up a bit, I'm mostly leaning towards the VA3. I'm just looking for a few more opinions from those of you who have experience with the VA3. Now I have seen (and read) other topics here about the VA3. I wanted to make a topic of my own, however, because I'm mostly interested in knowing how the watch performs in the water. Do you recommend the VA3 or should I look into the forerunner or fenix models more?


(Now, my friends and I are avid geocachers as well, so info surrounding GPS and hiking is always welcome as well.)

5,Headphones for the 645 music?,"I recently purchased the 645 music because I hate running with my phone a enjoy music on long runs plus it has buttons.

I wear my watch on my left wrist and First i used my friends ipod air and they dropped out a lot (as expected) so I splurged and bought the Bose soundsport headphones and they drop when walking or it's very windy, next I bought a well reviewed taotronics which on the garmin forum claimed would worked great but the same problem (it even dropped out during my run).


I just want a good pair of sport headphones that would work well with the watch when walking, running or just at the gym. 


Any one have some advice


Update: I ended up getting the Skull Candy Method Sport. Work great no problems and never call out no matter the activity.

1,Accuracy of Inreach Tracking in the rain,"Over the weekend we did a hike in heavy monsoon rain, in a heavily wooded area - but with a clear view of the sky all the same. I have used numerous GPS units (including my phone) in heavy rain and have never had a problem with tracking accuracy. I understand that accuracy can suffer in adverse weather - but this one was strange.


We got about two miles in before we decided to turn around because of worsening weather - it was a straight trail with no turn offs. It was taking a while to get back to the trailhead - moving slow having to get through so much water, so I wanted to double check our position. I pull my Garmin Inreach Explorer+ out of my backpack's mesh shoulder pocket (a common place to stow it while hiking that should not affect accuracy) And see that it shows we have hiked in a circular loop. But that was impossible - we were on a straight trail and came back the way we went in - there were no turn offs to go any other place. So I got to thinking that maybe the GPS hardware on board isn't up to the task. I have tracking points set to 1 second - highest accuracy. Has anyone else experienced this problem with InReach GPS accuracy specifically?",2018-07-17

6,Is there any way to customize the elevation graph for an activity on the Garmin Connect website?,"I live in Denmark, so any elevation changes I have are pretty small. When I look at an activity in the Garmin Connect app (on Android), it nicely scales the graph axis so the changes in elevation is visible, like this: 
https://i.imgur.com/s66EpDK.jpg


However, if I have a look at the zoomed in graph (or even just the non-zoomed in version) on the Garmin Connect website on PC, the elevation graph is not scaled at all, and seemingly goes from and to some standard value. This means that I can barely see the elevation change, because my changes are fairly small. It looks like this: 
https://i.imgur.com/HfPcHNK.jpg


For comparison, it seems like the corresponding graph for heart rate does the correct thing on both the app and website.

3,Vivosmart HR: a rant,"I've had various vivosmart devices since 2015, occasionally getting a replacement under warranty for different reasons. Recently, I started swimming laps again and was using it to track things like time, (approximate) heart rate, distance (manually added after), and intensity minutes. I had posted a week or two ago about not being able to add the distance anymore and finally caved and contacted Support. It seems an update was done to severely cripple the device. Rather than at least getting some information about my swims, I was told ""since the device isn't designed to track swimming, the update made changes to that part of activity tracking"". It no longer uses the exercise I get towards my intensity minutes. The distance never shows up when I try to add it. What's the point of a ""swim proof"" watch that can't track swimming??? Now I'm worried because I also just got a vivoactive 3 (and was planning to give the vivosmart to my mom but it sounds like it won't be much use to her either), but now I'm worried I made a bad choice picking the VA3!",2018-07-19

3,"Problems with my new VA3, should I return?","I'm getting really frustrated with my new VA3. I have two main problems (so far). First, it's terrible at measuring my hr when biking. I'd say it's correct less than 25% of the time. Usually way under reporting sometimes way over reporting. The other problem I'm seeing is it appears to be way over estimating my active calories. Take for example today. I did about 8000 steps, some of which was heavier work in the garden. Is expect about 300 to 400 for the steps alone, and 100 to 200 for the garden work. Garmin said I did 1200 active calories which is over double what it should be.

Phone and SMS messages get displayed on the 820 perfectly - wonderful. However, I have not been able to get any smart notifications to work. I have a Vivosmart HR and the notifications do correctly display on there (so smart notifications in theory do work), but I find that the vibrate on the watch is not strong enough to alert me when I'm the middle of a multi-hour ride. I'd love for them to display on the 820 screen as they do for phone/SMS - and all the literature says the 820 does support this functionality...


Does anyone have any tips for sorting this out? It doesn't seem to be simply permissions, because it works on the vivosmart.

4,Replaced VA3,"New VA3 with Silicone Straps and Protector for the Bezel


So Garmin replaced my VA3 because of the battery drain. (
VA3 battery draining

I tried to do a baseline of the watch and obtained a 0.833% drain (equivalent to 5 days).


Graph showing 0.8333&#37; drain (Baseline)


I then optimized the watch's battery by doing the following:




Turned off the side swipe


Turned off the bluetooth (turning on occasionally for sync)


Updated to SW 5.20


Reduced backlight to 30%


Turned off gestures


One widget only (Battery Widget)




This in turn optimized my battery life to around 0.644% drain (equivalent to around 6.2 days). This is shown through the light green graph above.


When plotting, I used 
this widget
 to precisely monitor my battery life though I noticed a strange behavior with the battery.


Zooming-in to the graph and isolating the green chart, I noticed a quick decline with the battery at first and normalizing afterwards:


Battery percentage green, Rate Blue


I think it's normal with this rate as long as it delivers to its 6-7 days battery life.


I even analyzed it further using a box and whisker chart to determine outlier data in the rate:

4,Garmin Connect / MyFitnessPal,"I'm a little confused, and I'm sure this question has been asked before but I've never found a clear answer to it.


When you create your profile in MyFitnessPal is asks the following questions:


How would you describe your normal daily activities?


Sedentary: Spend most of the day sitting (e.g. bank teller, desk job)


Lightly Active: Spend a good part of the day on your feet (e.g. teacher, salesperson)


Active: Spend a good part of the day doing some physical activity (e.g. food server, postal carrier)


Very Active: Spend most of the day doing heavy physical activity (e.g. bike messenger, carpenter)


How many times a week do you plan on exercising?


___ Workouts / Week


___ min. / workout


It then uses the information you give it regarding your weight, goal weight, age, height, etc. to determine your daily calorie limit. So it has already accounted for your supposed energy output that results from your daily activities, correct? So why then, when you connect your app with a heartrate/gps device like a Garmin, or manually input your daily exercise, does it ADD to your calorie budget for the day?


If I go for a ten mile run then Garmin will tell it to boost my calorie budget as much as an extra 2,000 calories that day. Hasn't this activity already been accounted for to some degree when I set my profile to say that I'm an ""active"" or ""very active"" person who plans on working out X minutes day for X times a week?

i used it both for a 5km run and in door gym (gym was 35 celsius according to v3, and think thats accurate, since no ventilation and 25+ outside all day). for the run, it was shit the first  km, had a hr of 140 average, but after first ""lap"" it immidiatly came to the 180+ that it is should be, and stayed there for the rest of the first 3,5 km. at that point i restarted the run to check if the hr was still accurate, it was. on the a370 it was steady at 170-180 the entire run.


when i was at the gym i took if for a view test. i started with normal training, with good warmup and normal training, it couldnt get above 130 and acverage hr was 98 (polar was max 145/ avg 122).
after that i took if for some vascular training. i did 2 different trainings, 1 with training pole (those for deadlift and squat) and second with water wheel.

9,How likely is it that we’re going to see a new budget triathlon watch from Garmin?,"I bought the Fenix 3 a while ago, and I haven’t been able to get used to the size and weight of it so I want to sell it and get a different watch, but Garmins lineup for triathlon watches is frustrating to me when the only options you have for getting a cheaper triathlon watch is to buy models that are several years old.


Are Garmin ever going to release a cheap, modern triathlon watch or am I going to have to wait until the 935 gets a permanent price drop to about $300? Suunto seems to be having a lot of success with their Spartan Trainer HR, which can be had for less than 200 bucks, and I don’t want to make the switch from Garmin if I don’t have to since I’m already in the Garmin ecosystem, but soon it feels like I don’t have any other choice.",2018-07-27

1,Garmin Express WHITE dialog screens,"I use Garmin Express to update the maps on the factory navigation system in my Honda Civic.  I have updated the maps several times in the past year without issue.

3,Advice for garmin sport-/smartwatch,"So, I've been looking into garmins sport-/smartwatches but there is a lot of info, options, choices, opinions and more so hopefully I can get some specific advice. I'll try to make it as specific as possible, but that won't be easy I guess.


Budget: Max  ~€400,-


Options checked so far (if there are other suggestions, it's always welcome):




Vivoactive 3


Forerunner 235


Forerunner 735XT


Forerunner 645




(Had a quick look at the vivosport, but decided I preferred a 'round' watch. Also a look at the 935 but decided it was a bit too expensive)


Area of use:




Just as a watch


Running and cycling (2/3 times a week)


Activity tracking


As a smartwatch (but that's not the main driver)


Live Track (for the GPS)




Nice to haves;




Option to use as navigation (not with waypoint, but really like a map). Not sure if any of the suggestions fit this.




I have no real preferrence for buttons vs touch screen.


So far I feel that the vivoactive 3 is more of a smartwatch and the others are more of a sportwatch. However I don't really have a clear view what the pro's and con's are of the vivoactive vs the forerunners.


As far as I can see, the forerunner 235 is a bit of an older version vs the 735 and the 645, but besides the specifications I can't really determine what the big difference is (also between the 735xt and the 645).


Anyway I hope this is enough info and thanks for the help in advance.",2018-08-21

I've tried everything until finally something worked. You need to go to security on your phone, and allow the Garmin app to show notifications. Before this - the music player didn't work, and I didn't get any notifications on my watch. After this - everything works.

1,Using course for trail races,"I'm running a trail 50km this weekend. The trail is on moorland and pretty exposed and lacking many landmarks.


Along with a map and compass, I thought seeing as I'm using my garmin to track the activity, why not utilise it to point me in the right direction.


&#x200B;


I would like to hear advice on using on the pros/cons of using an uploaded GPX/TCX file of the route on race day.


&#x200B;


Specifically advice on these questions;




If I create a course using the route data say 52km long and use 'virtual racer' and 'start race' option do I need to hit the exact distance for the activity to register?




What happens if I finish the event with only 51km covered on my watch?




Similarly, what happens if I get to the actual finish of the event with 53km on my watch? Does the activity cut off or will it keep recording until I manually stop it?

Or did I select 5 (or was it default) when I first purchased the device.


Similarly, where you indicate your HR zones, is the system smart enough to make assumptions based on the information it knows.  I mean, it has all the variables in both instances, and more, to make decisions on the fly.

I only use heart rate for aerobic base so as long as it is accurate with steady state runs around 130-145 bpm thats really all I care about.  I understand they lag in intervals but that's really fine with me.


I don't care about 24x7 monitoring or anything and wear another watch when I'm not exercising, so that doesn't really matter either.

Do the 645 and 935 use the same generation of elevate HR sensors?




Is the 935 likely to get an update alongside the Fenix 6 release? 




What features/sensors do you think the 945 might have? How likely is it that some will trickle down to the 645 via firmware (since the 6xx release cycle for hardware seems to be staggered vs Fenix/9xx)?




Will Garmin roll Body Battery out to existing devices that can support it (both models I'm looking at should be able to)?




Aside from battery life and power meter support is there any difference between the 645 & 935?

Update: I pulled the trigger on a 645. Also bought a Fitbit Charge 3 (I wear one on each wrist, as I use Fitbit to keep my aging parents active). The pulse ox was the sensor I was really worried I'd be jealous of on the next gen Garmins, so I've covered that base.

10,Running Power Estimator Data Field,"I am a beginner in running and was contemplating buying a stryd footpod to see what the craze surrounding ""running with power"" is all about. Luckily for me, I didn't have to spend another $200 to get a feel of it. I stumbled upon a 
data field
 that is meant to do exactly that: estimate your running power in real time.


I installed the data field on my Fenix 3 HR. While there are a handful of parameters you can change, I only adjusted the weight field to reflect my current weight. I went for an easy run without bothering about pace or anything, as long as I felt it was in a conversational pace. 
This
 is the resulting data set. As you can see, there seems to be a correlation between the power estimated and my running pace and the gradient of the road. I have no idea if my heart rate was taken into account; that's something I would have to investigate later.


I wanted to see if the power estimated correlated to perceived effort. I went for a 15 minutes run while trying to hold the power as close to 250W as possible. 
This
 is the resulting data set. While this is probably not the best test, as the road was almost perfectly flat, I felt I was putting in the same effort throughout the run. Next time, I would try to run uphill at the same power and see if the perceived effort is the same.


So far, this data field seems really promising. I don't really care about absolute values. What matters to me is the consistency in the correlation coefficient between the estimated power and my perceived effort. If this can be achieved, I don't see a reason to salivate over the prospect of one day buying a stryd footpod.",2018-10-02

I run and bike regularly and swim occasionally.  I've been looking at the scosche but have heard mixed reviews about the new rhythm 24 (and it might not even work with the fenix 5?) and it seems silly to get the old one.  Has anyone made this pairing with a Fenix 5 and the Rhythm 24?  Is the optical sensor more accurate than the one on the fenix 5?  I like the idea of the arm band over the chest strap but do not find the chest strap that irritating either.


What about the Wahoo Kicker?  I know chest straps should be more accurate than the optical ones but is it substantially more accurate than other options. 


I'm just tired of having wonky zone readings on HIIT runs, insight by those more versed in all of this would be appreciated.

&#x200B;


has anybody been able to reverse engineer rMSSD from Garmin's / FirstBeats Stress Level? 


&#x200B;


I was looking at my morning Stress Level as measured by Garmin and it does show some decent correlation to a scaled version of rMSSD (Marco Altini's Recovery Points in hrv4training, 
https://www.hrv4training.com/blog/hrv-features-recovery-points-and-more
). However, since - as a triathlete - I am interested in my morning/resting HRV, (all day) Stress Level is too much compressed, i.e. I usually wake up with anything between 2 and maybe 10-12 after a hard training day. So deriving the true rMSSD as measured by e.g. the F5+ series would be a huge benefit and allow me to stop taking manual measurements each morning.

But the Instinct doesn't have multisport activity, which is something I'd prefer to have but it's not really a dealbreaker, and I suspect that Garmin are never going to release a $300 or below watch that has multisport functionality, let alone both multisport functionality and ABC sensors.

3,[VA3]Garmin connect double counting run calories.,"I've had this problem for a while, I was wondering if there was any way to fix it, or just prevent it from happening.


Once in a while, Garmin connect just double counts the run calories by adding the steps calories. Just now, I came back from a run, and there's about 500kcal from it. But Garmin Connect also counted 400kcal for the steps, which sets the active calories to 900! Usually it knows where the steps are from and adjusts the active calories count, but it double counts regularly. 


I've seen to notice it happens when I pause the activity in the middle, not sure if that's just confirmation bias.

I'm not sure if the elastic is worn out, if this is a characteristic of the old style HR straps or what.


Can anyone recommend a better HR strap? I think I'll be buying one in the near future. I have a Vivoactive 3, so it will connect to either ANT+ or bluetooth HR straps.",2018-11-04

3,Fenix 5X with permanent backlight,"Hello, I already posted this in r/Garmin Fenix.
Hello fellow garmin friends,
I seek help amongst the wisest of ya'll. The thing is that I waited almost 2months for my replacement 5x (cause of the epoxy problems within the wrist heart rate tracker). Now I recieved my replacement yesterday and I am in shambles. The backlight of the watch is permanently at about 5%. This is incredible annoying at night and in dark places e.g. the cinema. At daylight I do not even recognize it very well. I already tried resetting the device with various ways, yet none of it worked. I am now very afraid I have to send it in again cause then I would be extremely mad, buying a watch for 700€ and then being unable to use it for 4months straight.

3,Weird Issue Calibrating Run...Mileage wouldn't go lower than 129 Miles on my 645,"So I've had my watch for a few weeks now and love it.  I do a lot of treadmill running and calibrate after every run.  Today I logged a little over 11 miles, which the watch logged as a little under 11.  I went to calibrate, and the watch wouldn't go below 129 miles.  The next entry below 129 was around 510.  I went back and forth in and out of calibrate a few times and the issue persisted.  I hit 129, thinking surely it was a glitch, and low and behold it gave me 129 miles.  


So, what's up?  Has anyone encountered this before?  


Side question: I fixed the mileage in the app; if I delete the activity from my watch, will it delete from the app as well (I'm using the Garmin app).  I would love to fix the mileage on my watch as well but I've had no luck figuring that out.

&#x200B;


I got the Vivoactive 3 a few months ago and using it was an awesome experience. 


Its been a week since Ive updated the watch to 5.50 and suddenly the battery life has been a nightmare. 


I havent added or modified any of the apps or watch faces that I had for a long long time. I just updated the watch since the app told me that theres a update available.


From a 3-5 day battery life it has been reduced to about 12h. Every morning I have to charge it or else it will die on me in the early evening. 


I tried everything. Getting rid of the apps and watch faces, fiddling with the settings but it was all for nothing. 


&#x200B;


Has anybody experienced such a rapid change of battery life after the 5.50 update or is it just something wrong with my watch?

34,Garmin Connect needs a REAL redesign (Polar Flow),"Hi you all. 


I am a Garmin User for many years, owning an Edge for Biking and for about 1.5 years owning a Fenix 5s and now a Forerunner 645. And I love Garmin watches. They are quite precise, the only wrist-worn wearables counting ""only"" about 20-30% more steps than my bra worn Fitbit One. They are intuitive most of the time and really quite comfortable to use and also wear. I have no problems with them most of the time. 


However the new heart rate sensor, beautiful display and look of the new watch and great battery life brought me to the Polar Vantage V, my first Polar ever. I can say I am not happy with it. Counting 100% more steps (yesterday 27000 instead of 13000), heart rate at the beginning of a workout takes long to adjust, touchscreen issues, not intuitive in my opinion. Lack of ANT+ doesn't help although I knew that before the purchase. Recovery Pro only with a real heartstrap, not even with an accurate arm worn heartstrap, yet alone with only the watch itself.


But what I love is Polar Flow. THIS IS INTUITIVE. It's clearly arranged, you can find what you search for within a few seconds. Polar Flow iOS app and web service is really what I want from a sport watch. You can find everything so fast, have a great view on everything. 


I know Garmin Connect got better within the last year I believe. But it is still horrible in my opinion. Not clearly arranged at all, so many submenus etc. It really is a horrible experience in my opinion. Why can't they get a real redesign, integrating many Polar Flow elements. The app got better I have to admit but the web service is still really, really bad. 


Anything planned here in a time where more and more people buy sport watches and wanna get fitter and Garmin probably will gain a lot of users?",2018-11-08

2,Calories Burned is out of control,"Hi guys, I just got Garmin Instinct this week and have been really liking it.  However I am having questions about the accuracy of calories burned throughout the day.  I understand that it's an estimation/ballpark but I think it's really off for me and I want to find out if there is any way to adjust it.  Let me explain a bit about my lifestyle first and what Garmin is telling me.




I'm very obese -- 6'2"" and 340 lbs (trying to lose and return to running eventually which is the whole point of this).


I'd say I have a lightly active lifestyle.  I walk about 10k steps per day (I had Fitbit before), run around a corporate office building all day, use a standing desk and wobble board for the small time that I am actually at my desk.


I don't exercise other than NEAT currently (I'd like to start an elliptical maffetone program, but need to achieve better consistency with diet first).


I have an RHR of 71 and by nature of being fat and out of shape, I get winded very easily.


I wear my instinct on my left wrist, and am left handed.  As far as I can tell, Garmin doesn't have a feature where you tell it you are wearing on your dominant or nondominant arm.




When I used Fitbit, up until I got the instinct, it would generally tell me around 5k calories per day, which is somewhat believable (RMR is around 3100 by formula).


Now Garmin is telling me that I am burnin almost 8500 calories per day.  3140 basal and 5330 active yesterday, for example.  I wish, but I am not that active.


I am thinking that this may be due to my shitty aerobic fitness combined with heart rate tracking.  In the intensity minutes I am seeing 200-300 minutes per day.  I don't know what 'intensity' means in Garmins terms but I do not think this is right.


Is there any way to adjust or calibrate this, or do I just have to ignore calorie tracking?  If so it's ok, I still love the watch (especially liking the weather features) and it's not like I vary my calorie intake based on what the watch says anyway.


Thanks and an advice or tips would be appreciated.",2018-11-09

1,GPX file noob with Forerunner 935 question,"Hi all,


I'm sorry in advance if this is a terribly stupid question; I'm not great with technology.  I have a Forerunner 935 for long distance running. Last time I used it for a 56 km race, the waypoint limit rendered my watch useless for much of the race. The race file had around 200 points, far surpassing the 50 waypoint limit, so my watch stopped recording distance/pace/location after 30% of the race.


I've got a 100km race coming up and would love to use GPX to stay on the trail. Can someone advise what workarounds there are for files with more than 50 waypoints? Besides breaking the file into smaller files (a huge hassle to start and restart an activity midrace), is there a way I can use this file for the whole race?

I exclusively run (up to half marathons, hopefully a full in 2019) and don't know what the best use cases for said feature are.


I am admittedly a techie. I know I don't actually NEED Pulse Ox as a feature, but I have a hard time passing up the ""gee whiz!"" factor. At a minimum I am looking to upgrade to a watch with a built-in HRM so I don't have to worry about forgetting my chest strap. Also, access to advanced running ANT+ accessories (specifically the Running Dynamics pod) is also something I'd find value in. Finally, I think a Fenix would blend in at least marginally better with work attire than the obviously-sport-watch 230. The 5X Plus is a bit large for my wrist however. Would it be worth waiting for the next generation Fenix in the hopes Pulse Ox comes to smaller sizes? Is there a watch that would better fit my needs?

I would charge my watch only once a week and 99% of the time it still had some battery left.

I recently bought an FR 235 to replace my mobile phone during workouts. I created 4 custom workouts via browser and loaded them on the watch.


I want a 4 field data screen, so I modified screen 1 to include 4 fields and in addition I disabled data screen 2.


My broblem is that when I choose a workout and proceed with it, I always get a 3 field data screen and have to move up/down to find the one I created in previous step..


However, as it seems it's only an issue with the custom workouts. If I start a regular run, the default data screen is my custom 4 field one.


Please can you advise what I need to do in order to set the 4 field data screen as the default for my custom workouts?


Thank you in advance.",2018-11-21

Sleep tracking


Activity Tracking (steps and elevation)


GPS jogging/running


Cycling


No smartwatch functions


Maximum battery life

3,FR 735xt frozen after connecting to phone,"So I went to sync my 735xt today (I've been bad with syncing it recently so haven't don't it for a while) and left it to do it's thing. When I get back it's stuck on the startup Garmin logo screen.


I have tried holding down the power button until it turns off and it just goes back to the logo screen. I've tried starting it up while holding the lap button to factory reset it and it flashes something briefly and then goes back to the Garmin logo.


I logged onto Garmin connect and see that there is a new update available (9.30 -> 9.40) so I'm guessing it tried to update over Bluetooth and managed to mess up the firmware. At no point did I click on anything on the watch confirming a firmware update so I'm pretty annoyed that it managed to brick itself this way.


I've had the watch for a while so I'm worried it's now out of warranty. Anyone have any suggestions or will I have to try my luck with Garmin support? The watch wasn't cheap when I first got it so I'd be pretty annoyed if I'm out of warranty and I end up with a useless watch because of a botched software update.


Edit: so I ended up getting in contact with Garmin support and after a bit of troubleshooting they agreed it needed to be RMA'd. As it's out of warranty I'd have to pay around £95 to get it replaced. I'm currently deciding whether to go down that route.",2018-11-21

2,Interval training/track workout question (Forerunner 235) ...Please help!,"I just recently got the Garmin Forerunner 235 and I was super excited that I could make workouts/do interval training with it. However, I'm having trouble getting it to do what I want.


I learned how to make the workout on Garmin connect and transferred it to my watch. I started the workout just to see how it'd work (without actually running, just sitting at my desk). My workout was a warmup, 2x 1 mile with an open rest in between each, and a cool down.


My hope going into it was that when I pressed the lap button, it would count as 1 mile, no matter how long it took me/what the GPS said. I was hoping that when I saved it to Garmin connect again, i could view my workout and it would say exactly 1.00 mile - 00:37 seconds or something (since I was just playing around and clicking it at random intervals) Instead, it said I ran 0 miles, since it was trying to base it off my GPS. I tried doing the same thing on the run indoor (no GPS setting), but it still said I ran 0 miles.


If this is confusing, let me clarify: When I do my track interval training, I just want to be able to click a button when I finish my preset distance and it will record it for me. I find that GPS doesn't work well on the track, and so I don't want it to rely on GPS for my workout. I was hoping that if I made a pre-made workout, that when I would click the lap button on my watch indicating my 1 mile was done, it would say 1.00 mile on Garmin connect, rather than what the GPS tells it.


Does anyone know how I can do this/if it is possible? I want to be able to go to my Garmin connect and have perfect rows of 1.00 mile then .50 mile rest, etc. based upon when I clicked the lap button.

11,My feature comparison between VA3 and VA3M (some info I did not find elsewhere).,"Alright, so I played with a VA3 for a month before returning it after I heard the rumor that it was being sunsetted (also the barometric sensor was definitely not working, I confirmed this by being at 10000 ft and it said I was at 7K which is quite a significant difference).  I picked up the VA3M for $249 and have been using it for a week or so.


Immediate differences:


VA3M advantages:




VA3M is 
faster
.  I'm guessing there's a CPU difference because the VA3M scrolls much faster and more smoothly than the VA3.


VA3M has yet to crash on me yet, guessing the additional storage space (and maybe other hardware changes) improved this.  VA3 would occasionally reset to different watchface (or freeze entirely).


VA3M 
4GB Storage space
: this storage space is shared across all apps/downloads, so you have more space for apps, watch faces, and activities.  This made a pretty big difference because one of the watch faces I use was around 200kb, which is half the storage space for the VA3.


VA3M has a 
gyroscope sensor
, this is not in the VA3, this affects directional accuracy when recording with GPS.


VA3M has 
WiFi
.  This is primarily used to directly download playlists from Deezer or whatever music service you chose (hopefully Spotify in the future).  It also downloads/updates EPO.BIN to improve GPS.  I'm not sure if the watch updates software over WiFi though.


VA3M has been getting updates slightly earlier than the VA3, like the Galileo integration


VA3M has more accurate 
altitude measurement
.  The hole is on the side of the watch vs the backside, at sea level the VA3 and VA3M read roughly the same, altitude changes are also read roughly the same, but the VA3 was unable to figure out my altitude past a certain point.




VA3M disadvantages:




Have not found bumper protectors for the watch yet, guess they're not in production?  I walk into door jambs a lot :(


It is a ""little"" bit bulkier.


No steel frame or steel backside!  It looks ""cheaper"" but the material is more scratch resistant.


No touchbar from the side, however on the VA3 it didn't work too well for me.


Cannot switch direction of the button, I sometimes hyperextend my wrists during stretching which hits the knob on my other watches, haven't yet experienced this with the VA3M but could be a concern.






I strongly recommend people get the VA3M over the VA3.  For all of the functions the VA3 does, the VA3M does it better at a similar price point.",2018-11-29

HOWEVER, I got on the trainer and did a 1hr cycling workout, the optical on the Vivosmart read in the 90s, low 100s for 5-10 minutes while the Edge/strap had me in the usual 150-160 range. 


I did swap out straps to a my wife's regular Tickr and even wore both straps at the same time to make sure they matched (they did). The Vivosmart consistently read lower by 20-50 bpm during this workout despite matching up occasionally. I played around with positioning on my wrist and tightness of the strap and it had no significant effect.


I didn't start an activity, or do anything to the wristband before doing the workout, should I be triggering an activity or something that may cause the Vivosmart to take more frequent readings or figure out that it's wrong? Is optical hr just inherently going to be inaccurate during workouts? I know straps are more accurate, but I would've expected a BIT more agreement between the readings.",2018-12-05

1,FR230 won't connect to HRM strap,"I have an almost two-year-old FR230 and HRM strap that were purchased at the same time. The last 2-3 weeks, I haven't been able to get the HRM to connect to my watch. I've done all the troubleshooting - my software is up-to-date, I tried wetting the sensors on the HRM, I changed the battery on the HRM, and I soft reset my watch. At this point, I'm stumped. Does anyone have any suggestions of anything else I could try?


Edit: two calls to Garmin and my HRM is just dunzo. They said most of the time the issue can be resolved by taking the battery out for 10-15, then replacing it. Tried that, nothing still. It’s out of warranty, so I guess I’m in the market for a new one.",2018-12-05
2,Editing sets on vivoactive 3 music,"Hi all,


I purchased a Garmin vivo active 3 music 3 weeks ago and have not been able to edit my sets on the watch during a workout.


I set up a new strength workout activity, from the Garmin connect website (training>workouts>create a workout) I saved the workout and sent it to my VivoActive 3 music device.


To start the workout I go to the Garmin strength app>workouts>select my work out>Do workout and then start the workout by pushing the side button. The workout, works and runs fine throughout. However, sometimes the rep count (amount of times I have lifted the weight) is incorrect. So during the rest stage (after the set) it gives me to option to select “edit” down the bottom of the screen, however when I tap this button nothing occurs, I have tried holding the button and hitting the button, but nothing happens. If I hold the screen down I am also presented with other options such as “edit last set” however again when pushing or tapping ect this button nothing occurs. I know that it is not the moisture on my hands or my fingers etc as every other button works in the strength program except “edit” and “edit last set”. I have also made sure that the “edit weight” feature in the settings in turned on. I can edit the reps in the Garmin Connect app once I have finished the workout, however I would like to edit the reps during the workout as there is a button for it and it is a feature that persuaded me to purchase this watch.


Any ideas would be much appreciated as Garmin support is beyond a joke. There suggestion was for me to send the watch away to be fixed with a return date of 3-4 weeks after only having the watch for 3 weeks.

7,"To people who have been using it so far, how is the VA3M holding up?","I’ve had a Vivoactive HR up until recently, because it decided to die on me while I was swimming (I’ve used it for swimming for less than 5 times, mostly only for running). I’ve also noticed online on the garmin forums that the VAHR gets water damaged really easily, so its not just my unit. Downside is, this happened right after my warranty ended (1yr) so I can’t get it fixed. 


So question is, now I’m eyeing both the Apple Watch S4 and the Vivoactive 3 Music. But what happened to my VAHR is giving me second thoughts about garmin durability (maybe just for the VA lineup, I expected my VAHR to last at least 3 years), so I was wondering if there are any common issues about the VA3/VA3M that you guys out there have found out about.

3,Fenix 5 altimeter issue,"I’m recovering from a inguinal hernia operation that means I can’t run for a couple of weeks so decided to fill the void with some retail therapy and splashed out on a Fenix 5 from amazon. Ive had a couple of Forerunner 235s in the past which apart from having brittle screens have always been very good for tracking my runs so I figured the long battery life of the Fenix 5 would be great for my first ultra (100km) run in 2019.


The watch seems great, much more solid feeling than the 235, but the altimeter is just crazy! After a calibration with GPS, with no other changes it will often steadily climb up in to the tens of thousands of meters of altitude. I’m running the latest drivers and software (as recommended by Garmin support when I got in contact with them), which appeared to solve the problem temporarily (the altitude didn’t appear to change at all for a couple of hours after a calibration) but then soon returned to its ridiculous ascent.


To be fair to Garmin after a bit of back and forth trying various factory resets and software versions they have now given me an RMA but they hope to turn around a repair in 10-15 working days and as we head into the holiday season I’m not exactly thrilled with the idea of being without a watch I’ve only owned for three days until the new year so am in the process of returning it through amazon as defective (they’ve dispatched another which should be with me tomorrow).


Google has returned quite a lot of threads (including this lengthy one on Garmin’s own forums 
https://forums.garmin.com/forum/on-the-trail/wrist-worn/fenix-5-5s/155092-
) of people discussing this issue, and quite a lot of angry people complaining about Garmins’s handling of this. I hope the amazon replacement doesn’t exhibit this same issue and I can just carry on enjoying my new watch but was wondering what anyone else’s experience of the Fenix 5’s altimeter was like?


I was sent quite a lengthy explanation of how the altimeter and barometer functions of the watch work and have read a lot of discussion online about the accuracy of this sort of measurement (impacted by the environment etc) so I understand there might be some occasional drift or inaccuracies to expect but what do you guys generally see?


Right now the watch o have isn’t fit for purpose. Even if it claims to calibrate with GPS at the start of an activity my tests have shown it recording climbs of hundreds of meters in a single one mile walk (on the flat!).",2018-12-10
4,Swim data looks different on Garmin Connect - VA3,"Hello,


&#x200B;


I have a VA3. I've noticed after this evening's swim that my swimming data isn't displaying properly anymore on Connect. Usually between intervals on rests there's no blue bar for pace and it leaves a gap. This makes looking at my pace on intervals easy (see photo 2).


&#x200B;


However, rests for some reason are now displaying as blue bars at a pace of 0.00/100m meaning 
A)
 it distorts the Y-axis and 
B)
 it's less clear at a glance how my interval pace is. I've enclosed some photos to compare. Looking back at all my recent data this is the case although I feel like this has changed recently.

Is there any way to see the graph/plot of your RHR over 4w without the values from Highest bpm obscuring the scale?


I know very well how my heart rate changes over the course of a month, and the trend it takes (I used to own a Fitbit) but with the highest bpm obscuring the scale, it’s harder for me to see the changes that I normally would.


&#x200B;


I've updated with photos as an example. In the fitbit one I can clearly see the up down and it's a decent enough scale that I can see how much it goes up/down. It has this same trend every month, and I use it to know how my body is doing at a given time. With the scale on Garmin being diminished by the peak BPM, I know I won't be able to see this trend as nicely as I would like.

I also don't think it's a deal breaker that I have to log swimming manually.


I am not bothered by the VM notifications, and I don't think it is a deal breaker that I can't respond to email or texts.


Am I wrong? Does the improved fitness tracking in the Active improve the experience? Are there people using the Move roughly like I am who can tell me to stick with it?",2018-12-25

10,User Review Instinct and Fenix 5,"I purchased both the Instinct and Fenix 5(just 5 - not X,+, sapphire )with the intent of returning one after a week of use with each one and making a determination as to which one is a better fit for me -I want to reiterate- best fit for me and my use cases and needs and for that the instinct was a better fit.


&#x200B;


This isn’t meant to be as robust as most reviews  many others have done that. I just tried both out and wanted to share my experiences as an average user incase anyone was thinking of one or the other.


&#x200B;


I wore them to work, on multiple runs, and in the gym. I typically bike as well but didn’t during this period. I did trail run though just to get some trees in the way.


&#x200B;


Aesthetics: I enjoy the gshock look but there’s no question the fenix 5 is a better looking device and is more appropriate for a larger variety of environments- looking at you formal “stuff”. That being said, I’m rarely in those formal environments and again, I like the gshock look a lot. Consequently for my every day work and play it’s a good fit but the fenix is still the better looking watch. The only thing I’ll mention not related to looks is the weight - the instinct is lighter and that’s great but honestly you don’t notice either a whole lot. Both fit comfortably.


&#x200B;


Durability: obviously the Instinct is sold as the tougher device. I think that’s probably true but I wasn’t concerned at all about the durability of the fenix 5. It’s a pretty tough looking device and I suspect will hold up to much of the same testing the instinct did. However, the screen is definitely a little more vulnerable on the fenix and that was a concern.


&#x200B;


Usability: the only real difference was in the buttons. Both were great. The instinct takes a little less pressure I think but I really don’t think I had a preference either way.


&#x200B;


Screen: So the fenix has the larger color screen and you can see more data on it. However, while not difficult to read I did find the instinct much easier to read - if that makes sense. Both were readable in sun, indoors, and on cloudy days. However, the fenix proved harder to see in when there wasn’t much light outside and required some additional focus. Ultimately I found the instinct screen very readable in all environments. When using activities, they were on par with each other.


&#x200B;


Customization : So connect IQ is super sweet. I completely agree with most that it’s sad it won’t be available for instinct. I used multiple watch faces and data fields plus a few widgets and apps. All were super cool and gave some great information. However, using those comes with a nominal battery and performance hit. For my use, battery life is very important to me and those cool things were simply not as important to me. I can definitely see why someone else would rather have connect IQ over the extended battery and again, that drain seemed nominal. The performance hit is also very subjective. I hit activities and it seemed longer to open. I have no scientific evidence to support it was actually slower.


&#x200B;


That being said, the Instinct watch faces and activity data fields are extremely customizable and provide the things I care about most at a glance for every day use and the activities I use. In fact, and I could be wrong so please correct me if so, I couldn’t find a way to add the outside temperature to the default fenix faces and you can with instinct. So speaking to just the default watch faces the Instinct provides a bit more data out of the box on one screen. The “bubble” helps with that (round window in the corner) Getting into bike, hike, strength, and run there were more ways to show that data then I would probably ever need and all the data I care about.


&#x200B;


Activities: I’ll get to gps in a moment but speaking from the activities capability they are pretty much on par (again, my limited use) but I can’t help but note that golf is on the fenix 5 and not the Instinct. I’m not a golfer, but I have many friends who are and this is definitely a deal breaker for them. Golf aside, and I didn’t go down the exhaustive list, but they were pretty equal. Maybe juggling was missing from both? Seriously, ton of stuff which is great. Garmins page doesn’t list the fenix 5 as having “Ellyptical “ but it does and works great.


&#x200B;


Otherwise they both have courses which is great, plus intervals and training. I used all three of these and love them on both. Fenix has back start and track back and instinct only has track back. The difference is with back to start it will get you back the quickest route and track back takes you back the way you came. I didn’t use those yet but my god do I get lost MTB and I know I’ll use track back in the future.


&#x200B;


They both also have 3D elevation options for ascents that I also have not used but sound great.


&#x200B;


The fenix also provides a ton more data for runners. Most notable VO2 max but also aerobic and anaerobic metrics and performance metrics. This nearly pushes me to the fenix and if you really rely on that data for your training then I would go that way. I run about a race a month - mostly 5ks but I do at least one half a year and a few 10ks and other distances, but I can definitely get buy with the data I get from the instinct. Cadence, HR, etc. I can also see the value in that other data. I just decided there were other things I cared about more - battery and GPS.


&#x200B;


Battery: Battery and GPS are the two things I expect if anyone does read and want to debate they will. I’m just going to say it - after one week I actually found the instinct battery to perform better. I also used the GPS on it more often. This was persistent after uninstalling everything from connect IQ on the fenix. Maybe I had a bad fenix, I don’t know, but It does seem like I was getting much different results then what’s cited. I seemed to lose almost 20% per day on the fenix compared to about 6% on the instinct. the instinct was also used more. I thought it was the watch faces and widgets so I uninstalled, rebooted, and charged the fenix to 100% and got the same results. Backlight and HRM were at default settings.


&#x200B;


The Instinct is on day 6 since it’s last charge and I have three bars. And this is where it could be misleading. Instinct doesn’t have a % for battery, just bars. However, there’s 5 of them so I just assume each one accounts for roughly 20%.


&#x200B;


The most notable event was one day I wore both (more later). The fenix was fully charged less then 24 hours prior and used 30 min of gps - the battery dropped to 84%. On the same day, the Instinct had those three bars (60% ish)and hadn’t been charged in 5 days. I also had roughly 60 minutes of GPS+GALILEO in that time.


&#x200B;


I do a lot of camping and activities that keep me from a charger. Battery life is key for me and by all accounts the fenix should have out performed the Instinct here and didn’t so this was big for me. I want to point out again - this was with nothing from connect IQ installed.


&#x200B;


ABC: so I found these both to be a wash meaning they worked the same relative to each other and worked well.


&#x200B;


GPS: I know this will stir up some stuff for sure. I’m going to try and keep it short and sweet. With only GPS on the Instinct I got the wobble you’ve probably read about. If not, it had me off track a bit - that’s the wobble. I was ready to turn it in after that as this is even more important to me then battery. I may not have been sold on the more robust data sets available via fenix but I certainly care about distance and pace; this is big for me as I think it is for everyone. However, I turned on Galileo and it was pretty perfect after. Plus, even with the wobble My distance was mostly as expected - just a little short (.02). The real test was when my wife and I ran a 5k. I wore both (NERD). I had GPS only on the fenix and GPS + GALILEO on the Instinct. Now, I completely understand that’s unfair and not apples to apples. I also know I could have used GPS+GLONAS on the fenix and it would have been more apples to apples. So, the rest of this is probably completely unfair and you may rightfully view it as a bad example. That being said - the instinct had me at exactly 3.1 when I was done and my pace was only 5 second off the chip time. The Fenix had me at 3.17 and about 10 seconds off. Not a huge deal, but from what I’ve read GALILEO is going to be more accurate then either GPS or GLONAS and based on this one , short, completely unscientific test- I would agree. Galileo is not available on the fenix 5.


&#x200B;


Now, My wife also had 3.17 on an AW3 cellular so there’s that. However, I know the course is 3.1 because we ran it earlier this year for another race and it’s a reputable timing company. That being said, .07 is not a huge deal I guess - but it’s still off.


&#x200B;


Here is where my real issue comes into play....cost.


&#x200B;


Cost: So as I was evaluating the devices it occurred to me the fenix looked better, and offered a ton more useful data. But (with the sale price) was $160 more with taxes. I had questions about the battery life and GPS accuracy. I had concerns over the screens vulnerability. The features I liked much more about the fenix all came with caveats - Connect IQ is sweet, but there appeared to be a trade off with battery for it. The extra run data is awesome but I’m not exactly sure I would use it. The looks are much better, but I also like the way the Instinct looks.


&#x200B;


In addition I found The Instinct screen to be more readable, liked the Galileo option, and actually really prefer the default watch faces and data fields to the defaults on fenix. I also don’t feel like I necessarily need more.


&#x200B;


Stir that all up and I didn’t see the value in paying extra for the Fenix 5. I don’t want to try and make the Fenix 5 out to be a bad device either. Hopefully it didn’t come off that way - It’s entirely possibly my battery issue was either incorrect percentage reading or a bad device. The GPS could very well of had the same results with GLONAS or maybe I’m really messed up and it was a bad course. The data is likely very much consumed by others Anyone who golfs would prob only want the fenix Connect IQ is definitely a great resource if you don’t mind the extra (potential) battery drain and (potential) performance hit.


&#x200B;


So there it is, it’s a short and limited test but since I did it, I wanted to share my results and hope it helps. I would love to hear your results if you’ve done it and totally expect a lot of arguments against my GPS testing. They are warranted but I still feel confident in my findings.

2,Garmin Fenix 5X vs 5 Plus - Battery &amp; Maps,"Over 2019 I'm going to be running a number of ultra-marathons (varying between 40-60 miles a day), a number of which are going to be self-navigated. Rather than rely on my phone to last the whole event (unlikely with GPS running for the whole time), so I'm considering buying a new watch. I love my Forerunner 235 (which I will likely keep hold of for ""normal"" runs) - thus sticking with Garmin seems like a no-brainer - but I'm a little torn between Garmin's watch offerings that include maps.


Right now, I can buy either the Garmin Fenix 5X or the 5(S) Plus for about the same price. I know they all have maps built-in, but I have read some online discussion of issues with the 5(S) Plus's battery life. The 5X seems more reliable in that respects - but would I be getting the same quality of map software in the 5X as provided on the 5 Plus? Or are they the same? Alternatively, is there any word as to whether Garmin has solved the battery issues with the 5 Plus line?


I do like the idea of the 5S Plus - but I'm guessing it has a further reduced battery life. The extra features in the Plus line aren't that exciting to me (I'm happy to keep my phone with me for music and contactless payments, especially since the ultras I'll be running require a mobile in their kit list for emergencies). The only thing I'm really not sure about is whether the Sapphire glass on the 5X would make any difference to me - I'm more than happy to buy a screen protector - so I'm guessing not, but any advice would be welcome.",2018-12-27

1,Garmin VivoSport Slate broken after two months... Don't know what to buy next?,"Hello! I have bought two months ago a Garmin VivoSport Slate after my Garmin VivoActive broke (where the wrist band was connected to the device) and it could not be repaired and since the VivoActive didn't exist. 


Two days ago, the wrist band of my VivoSport broke down - the gummy-like material snapped. I returned it to the store, but Garmin was not accepting it because ""there have been too many people who were complaining about the broken wrist bands so they don't take it anymore). The store sent it in for reparation, since it was only two months old, so I hope they can make it or anything.


I really miss tracking my runs with it, since I just discovered how to run with the heart rate monitor and stuff. I am a long distance runner, training for half a marathon. I don't swim with my device, but I sleep with it. My partner thinks it is because I wore the VivoSport daily and only taking it off for showering and bathing, that the band snapped. 


Because of my experiences, I am not eager to buy another Garmin. But, I talked to some people and they advice on buying a Apple Watch Nike+ or a Polar V Vantage. The Polar V Vantage is way too expensive - 500€ is not what I want to spent since I am a recreational runner. The Apple is nice and my maximum budget, since it is more than just a sportwatch. Also the idea of changing the wristbands to something more classic to go with clothing when going out, appeals to me. But I read a few posts about Garmin Forerunner compared to the Apple and 90% said the Forerunner.

I couldn't get it to stop, the screen just kept bouncing between the workout in progress/ workout paused screen. Eventually it just stopped on it's own. 


Later I was eating lunch and the screen went blank so I plugged it into it's charger and after a few minutes it started vibrating uncontrollably. It didn't stop vibrating for about 25 minutes. It's been totally unresponsive since then.

I could probably use the Ambit to track some basic data, but the 5X will obviously offer so much more. Any speculation on the feature sets that will come with the Fenix 6?  If Garmin is anything like Apple, then a new model will be more or less unremarkable and I won't miss any of the new ""features"" at all - like a new case color. On the other hand, if Garmin is known for actual innovation, (e.g. double the battery life) then waiting it out for a Fenix 6 might be a smarter move.

Was expecting my HR to be around 180 but it was at 60. I'm fitter, but not so fit that I can do this at basically resting heart rate (Can anyone?).

I received a Vivoactive 3 for Christmas and was wondering what watchfaces everyone is using? The default/stock ones are quite basic and don't offer too much detail/information display. I'm coming from a Samsung Gear S2 so some of the things I'm looking for would be:




Notification indicator (when there is a new notification) - this is a key desire of mine and it doesn't appear to be something I can have with the stock watchfaces


More classic/""realistic"" watchface (I realize with the e-ink-y/low-res display it has you won't mimic what the Gear S2 offers but I'd like something nicer than the stock faces)

6,Garmin VivoActive 3 Treadmill Activity Problem,"I got my watch last month and like it but have found something annoying. The activity called treadmill always assumes I'm running. Even though the treadmill activity is just ""Treadmill"", when it saves an activity, it saves it with the name ""Treadmill Running"" regardless of the speed you're going. It's easy to change the activity type from ""Treadmill Running"" to ""Walking"" even though there isn't a ""Treadmill Walking"", but it's annoying that the name stays as ""Treadmill Running"" and if you want it to match the new activity type, you have to change it by hitting backspace a bunch to remove the "" Running"" part or clear it and type in a new name.  


Is there any way I could get it so the activity name saved is ""Treadmill""? I'd be happy with that even if I'd still have to manually change the activity type. It would be cool if there was a ""Treadmill Walking"" activity type too.  


The reason I want this change is so that when I walk on the Treadmill it will show up on the app activities menu under walking instead of running. It would be nice if I can easily change the type to walking without having to edit the name too.  


I'd be more happy with just having a Treadmill Walk and Treadmill Run activity similar to how there are separate Walk and Run activities, so that I could calibrate my Treadmill Walk and Treadmill Run speeds without having them be way off. Currently I have it calibrated for running, then have to manually change the distance from the app when I walk because it's usually way off from the actual distance.",2019-01-03

2,Lost day after restarting frozen watch,"I was using my watch and it froze while in the activities menu. It wouldn't get unstuck and I read online that you could fix it by holding down the button to restart the device. After restarting my steps and intensity minutes from today were gone  and my calories are showing as being a lot lower. The app shows the correct numbers up before it froze. When I click to sync, the watch doesn't update and neither does the app. If I take steps, they don't get added to the total steps on the app either.  


Does the device just never sync back up with the app?  


I found another discussion of this before saying it only updates the app if you go over the value currently on the app in the remaining time of the current day. For example, if you had 3000 steps in first half, device crashes, then you take an additional 5000 steps, the 5000 steps don't get added to your previous 3000 steps. You're total for the day just gets updated to 5000, meaning it's off by 3000 steps and their is no way to edit/fix that.  


Would that be the same for Intensity Minutes? I find this would be even more annoying than losing steps because I had 60 intensity minutes, it would suck to have my intensity minutes for a whole week be off by an hour.",2019-01-03
2,Is there a more accurate ski app (Vivoactive 3),"I've been using the default downhill skiing app on my Vivoactive 3.

That also makes the total time for that run inaccurate as it's counting part of that uphill time, which also lowers my average speed quite a bit.  I see several other ski apps out there but wondering if any of them are any better in terms of accuracy?",2019-01-04

26,Have you ever dealt with Garmin’s investigative/claims team? My Garmin 935 is lost between Garmin warehouse and UPS and I’m out $500.,"Edit: Update down below!


Basically my Garmin had a shipping label created for it, Garmin claims they sent it out but UPS is claiming they never even got a package. There is a tracking number for the package but it just says “shipping label created” with nothing after that. So basically the package never left the warehouse in UPS’ eyes and Garmin thinks UPS screwed up and either lost the package or forgot to scan it onto the truck. 


Basically UPS and Garmin


The person I talked to from Garmin on the phone said I “probably should” get refunded. That wasn’t too reassuring lol. That line made me feel a little skeptical so I asked again and they said I would be refunded or the first one replaced but I’m weary now. I was told they have to open an investigation/discrepancy case. 


 It should be a pretty easy process. Does it take a few weeks of them investigating UPS/the warehouse or is it pretty open and shut? I need a Garmin or my money back so I can buy a new one to train with. Currently I have neither. 


Also to add to the frustration they haven’t added any kind of ticket to my case or account so the last 6 times I’ve called in the last couple of days I’ve had to explain my situation all over again haha


Update: They’re sending me a new one at no cost. Thanks Garmin! They were pleasant and very helpful with everything. They’re going to send a new garmin to us with no cost. They said if the other one shows up just send it back. I have a few guesses on what happened but I’m sure they’ll figure it out once they investigate. I think they boxed it up, created the shipping label, then went on their New Year’s Eve break and never got it it sent out. Or it’s also entirely possible UPS lost it as well.",2019-01-04

Pull Astro data into Garmin Connect via Fenix and skip the basecamp > SARtopo workaround, using a link or screenshot from Connect instead.
I know that the Astro can talk to the Fenix through the ""dogtrack"" widget but it seems like that is more of a heads up display than an actual data track transfer.
 


Connect Astro to iPad Pro and download raw GPX files, then upload into SARtopo on iPad.
I've tried using a USB-C adapter to access the Astro from iOS files, but it doesn't show up in the list.

1,Which HRM to go with Fenix 5x/Plus for training - HRM Run vs Wahoo Tickr ?,"Greetings,


&#x200B;


I am planning to buy a Garmin Fenix 5X or 5X plus, and need to decide which HRM chest strap to get with it. I understand the OHR sensor is the Fenix (or any wrist based OHR for that matter) is good enough for daily activities (resting HR, brisk walking, sleep tracking, etc), but for running and training/cardio it can be found lacking.

My primary requirement is being able to see my HR with a fair degree of accuracy (+/- 5-10 is all right), but I want to observe it REAL TIME (or after few seconds of delay if it has to be) on my watch, for my strength training/cardio regimes and runs. I  have just got into training (have a really bad stamina) and still in very early cardio conditioning phase but I am noticing I am getting into an elevated HR stage pretty quickly and often (running out of breath and needing to break out of the activity for moments). So primary requirement is I should be able to observe my HR with good accuracy in real-time so that I can keep my training patterns can be within a defined range, and also observe my conditioning pattern over weeks to see improvements.


&#x200B;


I have been reading other threads and have narrowed down to the following 2 options - Wahoo Tickr ($50) or Garmin HRM-Run ($99). HRM-Run offers advanced running metrics which is a plus but not really something I need at this point, while the Tickr offers bluetooth connectivity and can come handy when for some reason I dont have my watch on. However the primary requirement is I need to be able to see my HR (bring transmitted by the HRM strap to the watch) almost real-time on watch when I want to. Would I be able to do this with either of these 2 chest straps when paired with a Fenix 5x/plus? Also, to observe the HR on my watch from the HRM strap,  would I need to turn on an activity on the watch, or just the HR widget/tile (dont have the watch yet so dont know the exact option)?


&#x200B;


Thanks in advance !

1,Can you import workout program into Fenix 5X plus?,"Hey guys I am training for my first Ironman and have a 30 week training program that has slight variations with nearly every workout. This means if I have to use GC workout creator I would have to create a workout for each individual workout. That would be creating around 270ish different workouts. I find the GC workout creator too laborious (and unorganized but that's a different problem) for such a lengthy workout program. I was able to recreate the workout in an Excel file and was wondering if there was a way to import it into my watch.   


Secondary question, if I can't import an Excel file into the Fenix 5X plus is there any file format that can be imported into the watch to make creating workouts any easier?",2019-01-14

0,MyFitnessPal sync problems,"Hi friends, my partner recently purchased a Vivoactive 3 music and after wearing it for a month we decided to connect it to her MyFitnessPal account so she could track her calories in/out.  


We did this last night at 8pm and we also changed her calorie goals as they hadn't been updated for a few months. However the changed goal does not seem to have synced with the Garmin app (it is now 10pm the following night) as it is still showing the original goal.
I have heard that this can be due to needing to wait for the MFP day flag on their servers, however it has been 24 hours so I would have thought that this would have been applied by now.   


The above is frustrating, however it is not the biggest problem. The worst problem is that since syncing the MFP account, her active calories has increased dramatically. For the past month she has a BMR of around 1800 and an active calories of between 200-800 depending on activity level.
However since last night, her day today has managed to log 1800 active calories. In addition to her BMR, her total calories for the day is 3600 and still climbing. I think some sort of double counting seems to have happened.  


Have any other users experienced this and perhaps hound a solution?",2019-01-14

4,Quality control for Garmin VivoSport,"Hello everyone, I owned a VivoSmart HR for two years, I never really had any problem with it. It's just that I fell ready to get new stuff. I looked at FitBit but, after readings all the comments on the Internet, it looks like FitBit products are highly unreliable. Determining how long will your FitBit last is like rolling a dice, at least that's what I saw on multiples forums. So, I decided to stay with Garmin. I tried the VivoSmart 4 but, the screen was way too small for me and it is an OLED. It's important for me to have a transflective LCD because, it has an always on feature. 


I bought the Garmin Vivosport, it seem to be the perfect choice for me but I just wanted to make sure, it has good quality control. How strong is the wristband? Will it last for at least two years? It need to be strong because you can't replace it. I have 30 days to return it in case I'm not satisfied, that's the policy of the store.


Sadly, it look like Garmin is moving away from Transflective LCD display. They are bringing more and more watches with OLED. I hope they will keep producing a few LCD watches. Otherwise, I'll have to get something like the Amazfit Bip.",2019-01-14

1,Trying to decide between Vivomove HR and Vivoactive 3,"As the title says I’m trying to decide between these two models. Never owned a fitness watch before so hoping to get some advice from people who have used them. Looked at Apple watches but quickly decided against those and did some more research and think I’ve narrowed it down to these two. 


It would mostly just be used for basic HR tracking. I play hockey a few times a week but probably wouldn’t wear it while playing since I don’t trust it not to break so it would mostly just be tracking my weightlifting and cardio in the gym along with regular daily stuff. I work as a landscaper in the summer so it would also be getting dirt and grass on it a lot. Don’t really care about judging sleep quality since I feel like I’m pretty good at judging that when I wake up. 


I like the look of the Move a lot better and the fact that it’s cheaper has me leaning that way. I just want to make sure that I’m not really missing out on anything by going with it over the Active 3.

Last night when I swam it made it to 42, and then when I stopped it, and restarted it, it wouldn’t count at all, even after being turned off and on.


I used to do 100+ length swims when I had my fitbit, but I have trouble keeping motivated when it stops counting laps on the garmin…


Does anyone know of a fix for this, or do I need to just get it replaced?

I'd been planning to wait on the Fenix 6 hoping for a couple more things on it, given that my 645 is performing just fine for me - I could use the multisport activity type, but there is a CIQ app for that, which I still need to compare to my 910xt which is still an option.

It began to dawn on me that this HR spike I usually see towards the end of my runs when not using the chest strap might be false.  For a while, I assumed it was fatigue.  Looking into it, I discovered 
this
 app.  It allows you to run the optical HR and strap at the same time while saving both into the fit export.

During this run, the goal was to stay under 148 bpm.  Green is the difference between the two HR readings.  On the bottom, orange is times when I falsely would have believed I needed to slow down.  Light blue is times when I wrongly would have believed I could speed up.


Today I wore the watch as I usually do.  Now that I have this, I will toy with band tightness and wrist position to try minimizing these differences.

Doing so now just leaves the rogue playlist that no longer has any associated MP3 files.


So, if the only way to get rid of that playlist is to do a Factory Reset, will I lose all of the history I have on the Garmin Connect site?

&#x200B;


I run about three times a week. Not for too long a distance however I plan to change that and get more into running as a consistent exercise and eventually to do a marathon.


&#x200B;


Recently I had been using a Vivoactive 3, however it had an issue with recording elevation and it had to be returned this week. I had only really started getting into Garmin IQ, and recently discovered that some watches can give me some useful insights. So my options are ideally what is in the title: Fenix 5 for £319.00, Fenix 5S for £319.00 or the Forerunner 735XT for £230.00 (935 is an option and likely more comparable, however I want to get your insight on what I may be missing).


&#x200B;


I should note that I get 12% discount on top of these due to the retailer I work for, so tie that into the equation. I don't really want to exceed much farther than £300 in budget. I guess my main concern is whether or not weight and size is a concern to many (I'm a slim, 6""2' build with skinny wrists) and whether or not I would be missing out on much of value from any of the above models.


&#x200B;


Edit 1: I've seen the 645/645M offerings however the company I work for doesn't sell these, so it doesn't really meet the same prices there about as the Fenix range mentioned above.

I was wondering if anyone knew of any way to interpret the downloadable .fit files as an actogram.


I'm currently taking a course at my university regarding circadian rhythms and one of the projects we're given is to track our sleep data (along with other physiological metrics such as heart rate and temperature) for two weeks and compile it into various charts and graphs and interpret the correlations between these metrics, external inputs, and our sleep activity.

We are now at 16 months since the release of FR30, but since that was basically a FR35-light, I would say we are almost 29 months away from the last proper budget Forerunner release with the FR35.

3,Should I buy a brand new Forerunner 35 or a used Vivoactive(no HR)?,"I’m getting into running with a goal of finishing a my first full marathon in October. Looking for a watch to track my runs (both outdoor and indoor runs). 


My colleague lent me his 4yo Garmin Vivoactive (no HR) so I could try it out. I’ve been pretty happy with it. It does everything I need it to do except track heart rate. It has some wear on the bezel but is in decent enough shape. 


My questions are:




For my use case, would you recommend that I buy a brand new Forerunner 35 or this used Vivoactive? The Forerunner 35 is enticing because it would be brand new (though I know the watch has been on the market for a few years), has an easy-to-read display (from what I hear) and a wrist HR monitor. The Vivoactive has a colour touch screen and more functionality (I like to golf 4 months out of the year so the course GPS sounds intriguing), though it’s an older device and has no HR monitor. 




The new Forerunner 35 retails for $200CAD while a new Vivoactive retails for $350CAD. What do you think is a fair price for the used Vivoactive from my colleague? At what price does it make more sense for me to get the used Vivoactive over the new Forerunner 35?

Since then, I'm only getting Run Cadence.  I haven't found any useful related information searching online.


Does anybody know if there has been a change to the base Treadmill app that would have removed those fields?  I guess that I will change the HRM-Tri battery, but it doesn't seem likely that it would provide HR and Run Cadence with a low battery, but not the other fields.

0,Note to enabling Galileo on ‘new’ ‘old’ Garmin devices,"My first Fenix 5 was just replaced due to a button issue. When I updated it via BT to 12.3 the update did not update the GPS. I then tried to update it via Garmin Express to no avail. What eventually worked was restoring it to new and updating via Garmin Express.


Take 2... 
With the replacement Fenix 5 I thought I would be smart and update it immediately using Garmin Express. The battery was dead and when it came on I had it plugged in and ready to go. I added it and checked for updates via Garmin Express. After a few syncs it found the update and applied it. Once disconnected, it asked to apply the up date on the watch and I did that. It restarted...


.. aaaand... Galileo option is still not there.


I don’t have a ‘need’ for Galileo other than wanting it. I think with this new F5 I will just use it for a few days and then check Garmin Express for an update. If no update is offered after a few days I will try the Restore to New option and update with Garmin Express like I did the first one.

I have the Inreach mini and I have a question about tracking.

Is the tracking only so that others can see my route, or is it necessary for the creation of a route? I am not really understanding how this works.

1,Is the Garmin Vivoactive 3 a good M600 replacement?,"So basically, my current watch is the Polar M600, which is powered by Android wear. I returned it tho and about to order a Garmin Vivoactive 3. I returned the M600 because as a concept it's great, wear OS features with advanced fitness and exercise tracking, but it's executed quite poorly imho. Battery life is horrible, not even 1.5 days even with Android (polar claims 2 days with Android) and my required minimum is 2-3 days, it doesn't have real sleep tracking that a free android app running on a phone can't do, it doesn't have a barometric altimeter, it doesn't have 24/7 hr tracking, it doesn't have vo2max estimation, and you can't get a band that isn't cheap feeling silicon so this isn't something you'd want to wear to a business meeting. If it were priced cheap, like 100-140 dollars maybe that would've been understandable, but at its current price that's a joke. I looked online and it seems the Vivoactive 3 has the above features covered. I frankly don't care about onboard music storage, cause I have LDAC on my phone, and my headphones support it so listening to music running on a watch would likely result in a downgraded experience.

1,645M audio cues question,"Hi - 


&#x200B;


I'm looking at the 645M as my next watch. I'd like to get more info on how the headphone audio cues work with structured workouts. Do you get audio ques thru headphones when changing steps in the workout, or are those only via vibration on the watch? Ex. going from 5:00 in HR Zone 1 to the next step of 10:00 in HR Zone 2, does the watch give you an audio cue over the headphones? Can someone who has one help?

https://forums.garmin.com/forum/into-sports/garmin-connect-mobile-application/garmin-connect-mobile-ios/1452495-elevation-graphs-disappeared/page2?view=thread


Not sure when this happened but probably sometime in the last few weeks I've noticed that in the iOS app:


1.
 The scale on the pace graph (min/km) is way off, so much so that it just looks flat.
E.g. I ran a 5km and my average pace was 4:20mins, however the scale on the graph goes down all the way to 33:30mins/km. The pace never drops to that level throughout the activity.


2.
 There is no longer an elevation graph. I still have elevation data since I can see the total elevation gain/loss in the summary screen. But no graph.


I have the 935. which has a barometer for the elevation data so its not an issue with GPS.


Someone made a thread about the elevation issue already but thought I'd mention it in this post in case its somehow related (link to thread here:

3,Can anyone tell me why Vivoactive 3 randomly lights up or vibrates?,"Hi.


My VA3 is only a week old and I'm still getting used to it, but there are a couple of things that I can't figure out.


Firstly, the backlight comes on randomly for a few seconds and then goes off every 1-5 minutes. I've already changed the 'Gesture' setting to 'Only during activity' and that seems to work (i.e. it comes on when I'm in an activity and raise my arm, but it doesn't come on when I raise my arm while not doing an activity). But despite this setting the light just comes on when it feels like it when I'mnot doing an activity.


Secondly, the same kind of thing is happening with the vibrate - it will buzz for a full second and then stop, only to buzz again randomly 1-5 minutes later. This one especially is preventing me from wearing the watch daily as the frequent buzzing gets annoying very quickly. It happens all day long, whether I'm doing an activity or not.


With both types of behaviour there are no messages on the screen or any hint of what it's trying to tell me. The battery is over 90% and they still happen whether I'm sitting perfectly still or moving around. They are not related either - it will buzz OR light up, but never at the same time. Also there is no pattern, sometimes it won't happen for 10 minutes and sometimes it will go 3 times per minute. I have been through every menu & setting I can find and even temporarily disabled every feature (bluetooth, workout detection etc) but it still happens. There just seems to be no explanation for either of the things.


Can anyone tell me why these things might be happening and how I can stop them?

6,"Sorry for doubting you, Garmin!","So, in addition to my previous posts I ran some comparisons over my workout stats from different devices and also tried the Suunto 3 Fitness. And I have to reevaluate my approach. The main reason I decided to try the Suunto 3 was that I really liked the all black design. But not even after 24 hours the watch went where it came from. I can't say a bad word about it, it's an excellent good looking, lightweight and comfortable watch that does a decent job with workout tracking via OHR, but the downside is the Suunto app - for what the watch can do, there's only a few possibilities to dig data from the app, and that's a shame, not at all comparable with Connect. Also Garmin offers way more customization for the watch faces, in case you'd prefer to see your calories instead of steps. But what's important is the workout tracking. I wore both during my training session this morning and ended up with almost identical calories (460 on the Garmin, 469 on the Suunto). I just had to try... :)
So I have to admit I was wrong, the calorie tracking is okay, or at least matches other devices (including AW3), yes it varies in time and over devices, but I guess generally I was overestimating my burn based on my previous experience. Blame me, I'm sorry and will love and appreciate my Garmins from now on. :) (Still don't like wearing the chest strap though, but it just works better...)


So now my biggest problem is what band color I want to buy in addition to the Red/Pink one I originally have on my F645M. :D

3,[Advice] Running watch advice,"Looking for some advice for a running watch.


I have been using the Samsung Gearfit Pro 2 for about a year to run while listening to music. In the beginning it was ok, but recently I have been getting interested in tracking my distance progress. For this, the gearfit has proven to be awful, although it has a GPS, the distance measured is usually off by 0.2 km or more (see

I have seen different options and so far my best candidates come from the Garmin brand: 
Garmin Vivoactive 3
 and 
Garmin Forerunner 645 Music
.


I've seen the Forerunner has a lot of advanced functionalities and is an specialized watch for running, but on the downside its price is quite high (US$450).


On the other hand, I've read the Vivoactive 3 is more of a fitness oriented smartwatch, not specialized in running (so not so many advanced metrics) but is supposed to do a nice enough job for most runners (like me). The upside is a lower price (US$ 280). My main concern here is about the tracking capabilities of this watch, as my last experience with the gearfit2 pro has shown me that general fitness watches can be quite awful at distance tracking.

&#x200B;


You have to find your music through the interface on the watch, which I think is weird; I expected that I would be choosing the music via my phone. It appears that to get music you must 1) be in a viable WiFi zone to which the watch has been connected and 2) be in range of your phone with Bluetooth turned on and the GarminConnect app running (someone should verify this, I got an error at one point). Then, you go to the watch app and choose a playlists to download. It downloads it directly over WiFi, not via the phone (someone should verify this as well). I chose a couple of playlists that were suggested by the app called ""Fun Run ..."" and such.   


When I first selected a playlist, the watch told me that 23% battery was not enough to download and instructed me to plug the watch into a charger near the router. Downloading a playlist with 60 tracks takes a good while (15 min?), so I think this was good advice. But, once a playlist is on your watch, it plays back without need of your phone at all.",2019-02-22
3,VA3M/Spotify/Wifi Issue,"I don't think this problem is particularly related to the newly released Spotify for VA3M.  It just makes it more notable since it relies on wifi connectivity.


The Spotify app installed and authorized as expected and the playlists get shown. On selecting a playlist, however, more often than not, the watch displays the ""no known wifi networks found"".  Sometimes it displays the error quickly, sometimes it takes a minute or two.  If I keep trying, however, it will eventually get the connection and the downloading will begin and complete as expected.  I seem to recall the same issue with the Deezer app (which I've already uninstalled) so I don't think it's a Spotify issue.


The watch is plugged in and within a few feet of the access point.


Has anybody else had this issue?  The only network configuration issue I can think of is SSID for the access point is hidden. I may set it to broadcast and try again to see if that's the culprit.


UPDATE: It is, indeed, the hidden SSID that causes the trouble. It connects almost instantly to a visible SSID. Looks like it's time to bite the bullet, re-configure my wifi network, and re-pair 2 dozen devices. Oh well...",2019-02-22
2,Apple Health Data for Walking + Running Distance is wrong,"I have the 'connect' ios application set up as a 'source' in apple healthkit. I have a Fenix 5 Plus.


For most metrics like 'steps' and 'heartrate' it is working correctly, with different data points being created throughout the day. However for 'Walking + Running Distance' it just creates a single entry spanning a 24 hour period (from 00:00:00 to 23:59:59) and it adds all daily distance to this entry.


This has the effect of causing duplication in my the overall 'totals', as when I also have my phone with me, it adds both pieces of data. Because the Garmin Connect app isn't accurately logging the 'time periods' of the data, and doing it as one big lump.


How do I need to set things up so that my daily distance is accurate? I don't wear my garmin all the time so sometimes I have only my phone with me, sometimes both phone + watch, and sometimes watch only.

2,Fixed a Fenix 3hr syncing issue,"Hello fellow Garminites (is that a thing?),


&#x200B;


TL:DR - If your watch isn't syncing, connect it to a computer and see if there is an activity file that isn't uploading to Connect (manually import it).  It could be blocking the rest of the activities.


&#x200B;


I wanted to share a syncing issue I had fixed, I thought maybe it might help someone in the future.  It was driving me nuts and I couldn't find a solution online between here and the Garmin forums.  


&#x200B;


Since 2/14 my Fenix 3 HR had not been syncing my activities or logging my all day tracking (steps/hr/floors/etc).  It was connected as I could see the current all day tracking and was receiving notifications on my watch.  However, at the end of the day, all that info was not found on the phone app.  It just disappeared.  I tried numerous things that I found through my searching (power cycle the phone/watch, disconnect the watch from the app, manually trigger a sync from the watch).


&#x200B;


One suggested was to manually upload an activity via pc (by USB).  Whenever I connected to my PC, Garmin Express would automatically upload all my activities from the past week.  However, when I went into the watch storage via File Explorer and looked at the activities, I noticed there was one from 2/15 that wasn't uploading.  I tried manually uploading it on the Connect site a few times and it kept failing.  So I deleted the file.  I disconnected my watch from the PC and ran a sync from the phone.  Success!  Then I started and saved a new run activity to test it.  The activity saved and sync'd to Connect.  Seems the issue was resolved.


&#x200B;


Something must have happened with that activity that was being tracked.  Maybe my watch died during the activity and it didn't resolve itself when I charged it back up.  I don't recall the circumstances.

1,Can Garmin Instinct control spotify? And two other questions,"Hi all, 


Just some quick questions. I have looked at plenty of reviews and online sources, but can’t find the answer.


I am trying to decide between the vivoactive 3 and the Garmin instinct. Overall, the instinct is more appealing to me because of the option to use courses (and more navigation options) the battery life and the durability of the watch. 


However, one thing that I can’t seem to find out is whether the watch can control Spotify. I know music control is a listed feature, but I can’t find out whether this would work with the Spotify app on an iPhone (8). 


I usually have my phone with me while running, so I don’t really need a stand-alone app on the watch. However, not being able to control it would be kind of a dealbreaker for me.


Second question: I am not an advanced runner, so I do not know whether the lack of VO2max data would be a dealbreaker in the long-run. Any thoughts on that would also be appreciated.


Third question: on the Vivoactive there seems to be stress tracking (and HRV like capabilities), is this also possible on the Instinct?


Finally, as far as I know, the instinct doesn’t support Control IQ, but I did read something about Garmin Connect. Is this a rebranding of Control IQ? Or are these different services?

5,"[Help] Tactix Charlie, iphone: widgets reset, cannot modify watch face fields","Howdy,


I just got my Tactix Charlie, and I must say, for a relatively premium product, i'm super disappointed with the software.




You cannot change watch face fields on iOs, a known problem since early February on the Garmin forums. Since the watch face is what I look at most of the time, being unable to change it to have the information that I need or want makes me feel like a fool for not just getting another Timex;


Widgets reset several times per day back to the default widgets, meaning that once again, the tools that I've set up to make my day easier aren't there, and I have to spend 5 minutes putting all the widgets back via iOS.




Does anyone have solutions to either of these problems? I'm pretty disappointed, it feels like I paid 700 dollars for something that doesn't have more features than a Timex (since they keep resetting), and those features that it does share in common with the Timex (stopwatch, timer, alarm), are harder to access and use (since my widgets reset, and I have to use the vanilla, deep in the menus, alarms etc).

My question is what type of watch would be best for my needs? Especially if I’m not stats oriented? Should I go for the 235 and try to get used to seeing numbers attributed to my runs and workouts, or just settle for a different model? I’ve been looking at the Polar 430 or Garmin 35.

It’s nice looking but the devices functions are not what I’m looking for. It lags and I hate that it has a stock images of people working out when searching for an activity to choose. Honestly that killed it for me lol! I’m going to return it and possibly go with the VA3 music. I prefer the all Black. How good is Garmin at tracking daily activity at work? I do hvac and climb extension ladders and walk on roof tops all day. Calorie tracking has been my only way to lose weight. I would like to keep my deficits as accurate as possible. Fitbit has been pretty good at this. I also run on the weekends about 10 miles over the 2 days. What exactly does the GPS do?

I’ve been wearing mine as my daily watch since October and—up until recently—have never had an issue with my watch dying on me during the day. Charging it was always a thing where I’d happen to notice the battery was pretty low after a few days, so at the end of the day I’d take it off and put it on the charger overnight and boom, I wouldn’t have to think about it for probably another 3-5 days, sometimes it felt like I was only charging the thing once a week.


Recently, I’ve been faced with the issue of being out at work—or worse, about to begin a workout—and I look down at my watch and it’s about to fucking die already! It’s been irking me pretty hard lately, especially when it happens the day after or two days after I just charged it. 


I began noticing this a little while ago and decided to just start paying extra attention to it. Well I also started paying attention to how often I kept my screen locked, and really started trying to keep it locked at all times and for a while there I thought that cleared up my problem. But now for the last few days it’s come back. I’ve had to plug my watch in overnight twice in probably the last 4-5 nights—today I had a half a charge at like noon, did a quick check to make sure the screen was locked (it was) and then didn’t touch my watch again until 5:00 pm when I got off work and it was about to die.

7,Garmin FR935 (APAC) from Amazon.com,"Guess I'll just chalk this up as a learning experience.


I purchased a FR935 from Amazon (sold by and shipped from 
Amazon.com
) back in February.  I had no problems whatsoever with the device but noticed that it was still on firmware version 12.10 while 12.50 had been available since March 5th.  After much thrashing around, I finally realized it was the APAC version.  Had it been a ""sold by <vendor name> and delivered by 
Amazon.com
"" or ""sold by and delivered by <vendor name>"" I would not have been that surprised. Since it was Amazon, it never occurred to me that it might not be the ROW version.


The description of the product doesn't designate APAC or ROW nor can I find a product number.  The comments, however, are full of folks complaining about the same issue.  I never looked at the comments since I wasn't looking for any information about the actual product.


Amazon offered a return with full refund, 25% refund if I wanted to keep the APAC version, or directed me to Garmin for a ""warranty exchange"" (which made no sense at all).  When I asked if I could get a full refund and then purchase a ROW version from Amazon, the rep said ""of course"" and then sent me a link to the exact page I had used to purchase the APAC version.  No thanks.


Getting the full refund and buying it from a local shop.",2019-03-12

Last week it was during a 21K trail race, today at Parkrun and has happened at about 3 or 4 Parkruns previously. Once I remember it recording for the first 3K of a Parkrun before pausing, at least that time it was only a pause rather than completely going back to the normal watch / home screen. 


I’ve been thinking I must’ve not pressed the start button properly so today I checked and the activity definitely started, I didn’t check again till the 1km mark and no activity any more. 


I run 6 x per week and it never happens on solo runs, even on warmups before a race or Parkrun or rides to & from. No complaints with the watch aside from this. I’m not doing anything different to any other run but it just seems to be when I’m in a pack with other people (say about 200 or so other watches being started at the same time).

I’ve recently upgraded to a fenix 5 from a suunto Ambit 3 and I love it! There is one metric that is really confusing me however and this is the cals burnt. I understand that different manufacturers will have different algorithms to how they work out cals burnt but I’ve found that the difference between the garmin and the suunto to be crazy! For example. Yesterday I did a 
27.5km
 fell run with 2000m of ascent in about 4 hours and according to my garmin I burnt 1950 cals. A few weeks ago I did a 
29km
 fell run with 1500m of ascent in about 4 hours and according to the suunto I burnt 4000 cals. I would have expected the longer run to be more cals however, not twice the amount! 
All my metrics are the same for each watch. 
Is my fenix 5 set up wrong or has my Ambit 3 just been wildly overestimating cals? 


It’s not usually a metric I’d be bothered about however, me and my mates run a monthly calorie burn challenge and they’re buzzing that I’ve upgraded my watch! Haha",2019-03-25

4,Why pay extra for the 645 over the Vivoactive 3 - help please!,"Over the last couple of days, I spent hours reading reviews and watching YouTube videos about Garmin watches. And with the help of Redditers, I also determined that the 'new' 20mm qr straps of the Vivoactive 3 and the 645 are actually quite solid.
That leaves me with the 245, Vivoactive 3 and the 645. So I decided that I probably cannot wait for a 245, which leaves me with the latter 2.
Looking at the devices, I see one main point of difference: touchscreen vs buttons. It seems to me that otherwise the screen quality is identical (rather poor, but ok). For me, instore the touchscreen felt quite decent and intuitive. But I am affraid it will be less comfortable when running. What is everybody's feeling about that?
Music is something I don't really care about.
The other main driver is the price: I can pick up the VA3 for around 200 euro. The best deal I found with the 645 is 389 euro including a running dynamics pod, bike mount, extra leather strap, international charger and a carrier case.


So what is your view on this: is the 645 really worth the extra money?",2019-03-26

 His reviews were amazing and his very detailed cross-comparison tables were a life saver. This post isn't necessarily a break down of the technical aspects of what Garmin provides.

If you're a casual adventurer who wants helpful tools on demand in a watch that can last more than 24hrs while still having smart features, this post is for you.


Coming from a Suunto Core, I was looking to upgrade to a watch that could relay smart notifications while also providing the updated tech for activities like hiking, general trail wandering, and other random activity tracking (SUP, sailing, etc.). Initially, the Instinct attracted me because of its price tag and its similar, rugged all-black look of my old Core. While a lot of people compare its styling to the old G-Shocks (I see it a little bit), this watch looks way better imho (nothing against you nostalgic people). But I was still worried about general wearability (i.e. a rugged fitness watch at a work event, etc.) Which lead me to thinking about paying a bit more for aesthetics..


So then I went down the rabbit-hole of price. If I was willing to spend $300, I might as well check out the 645 for only $100 more. And why not an extra $50 for the music version. But if I'm already at $450, I might as well look at the Fenix 5 for $500. And if I'm looking at a 2+year old watch (which is what also negated the older 935 and 735xt), I might as well look at the 5+ which gives me Garmin Pay, Topo maps, and music storage (and a whole lot more). All of a sudden I'm at $650+, after following the logical train that I don't necessarily mind spending the money if what I'm buying is going to make me happy and last me for at least the next 3+ years.


If you live near a FleetFeet or REI (I'm sure other stores allow you to try them on), you should spend a quick trip and go. I found that my quandary was immediately reduced between the 5+ and Instinct based on how the watch sat on my wrist alone. The 645 was too small and the 5S+ was small but oddly unproportionate with its thickness on my type of wrist (YMMV, obviously.) 


The Instinct ended up walking out of the store with me because at $300 I figured I could save the difference in money from the 5+ and buy a Fossil or TicWatch if I ever wanted a simple, more dressy smart watch for other occasions and still pay less while still getting all the function I could even need with the Garmin. This also gave me way less FOMO over ConnectIQ. And, if any of you are REI members, you'll get at least $30 back in dividends- essentially 10% off.


If this story resonates with any of you casuals out there, I hope it helps ease you decision. In addition to DC Rainmaker, here's a compilation of the most helpful posts for me when deciding which watch to buy:

TL;DR:
 At $300, the Instinct gave me awesome battery life, simple smart-watch features (notifications and music controls), and just the right amount of function for my preferred activities (hiking, SUP, etc.) GO TRY ON THE WATCH FIRST - It really does help. I still have $100-250 difference in saved money that I can spend on a daily, true smart watch if I want. I'm happy without ConnectIQ.

4,Fitness Tracker for Senior Citizen: Fitbit Charge 2 VS. Garmin VívoSmart 4 VS. Garmin Vivofit 4,"My mom lost her garmin watch and wants to buy a new fitness tracker to keep track of her steps and motivate her to walk. She says that the challenge of filling bars/graphs/circles/whatever they are is motivating for her.
She doesn't need HR or sleep tracking. 


What would you suggest?  I was going to suggest a Charge 2, but it doesn't seem like FitBit is very reliable. She likes the Vivofit 4, but for the money it doesn't seem a smart choice. Wirecutter suggests the Vivosmart 4.
What would you suggest? She has an iPhone 6 and is relatively tech savy (she can skype, use whatsapp, etc.).",2019-03-26

3,Garmin Fenix 3HR heart rate is extremely off,"So I just got my certified refurbished Garmin Fenix 3HR and was very disappointed to find that after my first workout the heart rate was extremely off. We're not talking a few points, it was off by at least 50%. When it was measuring around 70 my Apple Watch was measuring around 150. I also verified by checking my pulse that the Apple Watch measurement was pretty accurate whereas the Garmin was just dead wrong.

2,Garmin sensors and purchase advice compared to Charge 3?,"Hi everyone, I was thinking of getting a Charge 3 today because there was a local discount for wearables (not in the US). 


I was interested in Charge 3 spo2 sensor but turned out it wasn't used in Charge 3, lol. 


Then a redditor redirected me to Garmin's body battery feature, and so I pivot to this subreddit. For context I've never check out Garmin before so I'm completely new to Garmin's offering.


I checked Garmin's website before I wrote this thread but the website layout is not user-friendly compared to Fitbit because there is just so many categories. It made me confused as I'm going to buy it in the next 24 hours. and I'm confused which one I should look for. 


I'm currently using Charge 2. The reason I was about to buy Charge 2 was because I'm interested in the oxygen-in-blood sensro.


Now I understand from the website that Garmin have some feature called Stress Level, Body Battery?


Basically, which Garmin I should read the review of / should buy that is closest to Charge 3?


 I don't really need music and all that jazz.

13,FItness tracker or watch for running that can also work in the gym,"There is so much information out there it's hard to parse which tracker is best for what.


&#x200B;


I'm getting a bit more serious about fitness and am looking beyond Fitbit trackers. Specifically, I'm getting into more running, but I also have hips that give me trouble sometimes so I want something that can accurately track my efforts in efforts in the gym.


Must:




Be able to sync HR data to strava. My Fitbit can't do that, and I love the strava app.  I can't get the most out of it unless both GPS and HR data can be synced to it


A HR monitor good enough to track running


Can sync GPS with my phone




Nice to have:




Replaceable band


If the built-in HR sensor is kind of lame, the ability to sync with an external chest heart-rate monitor


Internal GPS. I don't mind carrying my phone with me on a run at all, though.


Not a complete waste of time at the gym. It doesn't necessarily need to count reps for me, and doesn't need to give me a perfectly accurate HR the whole time, but it would be great if it didn't tell me my HR was 80 during an entire workout...




&#x200B;


I'm strongly considering the Vivosmart hr+, but that doesn't allow syncing with external sensors and as far as I can tell is kind of lame for weight lifting. I'm also considering the Forerunner 235, but I don't need all the bells and whistles like Garmin pay


&#x200B;


EDIT:


Thanks for the comments, all. I ended up purchasing the vivoactive 3 and I like it so far. 


&#x200B;


I did one weight training session with it. The heart rate monitor didn't really work for this at all, but it still recorded the activity and did a suprisingly/delightfully good job of tracking reps and the type of exercise.


&#x200B;


I've done one run with it and it was great. The heart rate tracking was solid. The only downside I see is that the UI on the watch and in the Garmin Connect app isn't the most intuitive, but I'll figure it out with time.


&#x200B;


I'm happy with the purchase. Thanks for all of your suggestions!

3,Vivoactive 3 Music display is pretty dull..?,I just opened my new vivoactive 3 music and I'm noticing the display is pretty pale and very blue tinted. Videos online of people using the watch made its display seem much brighter and more vibrant. Is there a vivid setting or something I can adjust or is this how it is?

2,Which Garmin for a Polar A300 user?,"I have always had a Polar HRM- but I think it’s time to switch to Garmin. I use a A300 and a ‘

I don’t care how smart it is and I don’t need pay or music. I bike, swim both in a pool and open water, kayak, backpack, and hike.  I walk a lot, but don’t run.  I need good battery life for multi day rail trail bike/camp adventures. I’m thinking Instinct. Or, should I get a 235 and a bike computer?  Thoughts? 
I have done a ton of research- read all the Dc rainmaker blogs and am a little overwhelmed. Looking for practical advice.

2,Issue with swim workouts,"I have been having an issue where whenever I am doing a swim workout, the distance doesn't seem to be calculating correctly. I have tried yards as well as meters, but the end result is the same. Example, if I am swimming 200 meters (during a planned workout), the watch will go off consistently after I finish my glide on the last length. 


I originally thought this might have been due to me incorrectly assuming the pool was in meters, but it possibly being in yards, so I changed my metrics for my planned workouts, synced them to my phone, and tried again the next day. Using yards, the behavior was the same. The watch would go off right after the glide on the last length. This occurs on pretty much any length I swim, 25s, 50s, 100s, and 200s so far.


During my workouts the watch will go off, the distance goes back to 0 mid lap, and when I get to the wall I have to press stop followed by start and then it shows the correct yardage (meterage?) and then press the lap button to get my rest set to start.


Has anyone else run into anything like this? I have already done a bit of research on possible swimming issues with these watches (i am using the FR935; indoor swimming) and can say I am using a single stroke, not stopping mid lap, pushing off hard every lap (not flip turning).

2,935 (tri bundle) vs. 5s plus (sapphire),"Struggling with this decision...  


-Will be an everyday wear watch.  Office work with some occasional laying on the ground/concrete to write estimates.  (Scratched my last watch doing this... Ugh).


-Lots of lifting weights, CrossFit, and running.   935 Tri bundle wins here for lighter weight and heart rate strap included.


-I've owned the 935 before for a few months and sold for an Apple Watch series 4 in a moment of (stupid) weakness... but I definitely remember how awesome the 935 was.


-But I worry about the 935 for everyday wear getting banged up, and I like the looks slightly better of the Fenix 5s plus.. and it's newer and I've never owned one... I don't ""need"" maps or music, but I do think maps is a neat feature that I'd like to play around with..


-But the 5s Plus will cost more (~675 vs. ~550), has worse battery life (which would mainly be an issue for sleep tracking for me), and is a little bulkier (thicker, 16g heavier), so not quite as good for running/fitness and also for tracking sleep (which I did utilize with the 935).


-SAPPHIRE glass is Very appealing for me.  I like to keep my watches somewhat nice, and have not liked screen protectors in the past.  The Fenix 5s Plus seems like a more durable bezel/case than the 935, but I'm not certain as I've never seen a 5s plus in person.


-Lastly, I'm 5'7"", male, 155 lbs., thin build.  I owned a regular Fenix 5 and it looked like a Tank on me.  I did not enjoying running with that massive beast.  I also got quite a few ""your watch is HUGE"" comments.  Lol.   It had a silver bezel that I think really made it stand out as being large.  I'm looking at the all black 5s plus.  I really think it would fit me well.  (No dealers have it locally to try, unfortunately).


TLDR:


-Basically, I think I SHOULD buy the 935 tri bundle (makes more sense when you add everything up.. price, battery life, thinner lighter profile, etc.), but I WANT to buy the Fenix 5s plus sapphire (better for everyday wear, looks awesome, sapphire is appealing, slight newer tech/more features).  =]


-Both look like incredible watches.  I'm not really interested in any other Garmin models.  Anybody wanna sway me in either direction?  =]",2019-04-03

Cant see the sense in charging an activity tracking watch daily :/ [Can't even show RHR on that watch :( need the app]


So I am jumping ship to Garmin and I am tempted to get the Forerunner 935 as I am a data nerd when it comes to my running and occasional biking performance. I am hesitant to purchase it now though, as I don't want to be in the same position with Garmin stopping support for the 935 soon after I purchase it like I was with the Spark 3.

I can afford an extra couple of grand or so [South African here] on the newer watch if that will be a better investment in the long term. 6 months of bug fixes doesn't deter me. I like the bleeding edge of technology if  I can afford it.

I recently bought the garmin forerunner 935 and I absolutely love it. Battery life is superb, gps is precise, there's more data than I could ask for, it's simply brilliant.


However, there is one thing that I can't seem to get working. In the Garmin Calendar Widget, it's possible for me to see my next calendar activity that I have inserted into my smartphone calender. However, I haven't yet been able to find a widget, or tinker with the Garmin Calendar Widget, that makes it possible to see all upcoming calendar plans for the coming week or month.


I'm not referring to training activities, but regular calendar activities that I put into the calendar on my smart phone. I'm using a Samsung Android phone.


Has anyone found a way to make it possible to see weekly/monthly plans on a widget, that synchronizes with the calendar on your smartphone?


Any help would be much appreciated.",2019-04-10

1,VivoActive 3 inacurate distance measurement,"I started working out at the beginning of september and halfway through september I got a VivoActive 3 to track my daily steps and heartrate and sleep mood etc. But I also use it for when I go for a run.


I'm a beginner runner and using the Couch to 5k app by active on my OnePlus6. And the distance travelled at the end of the run was always different between the app and what my vivoactive have measured.


For example, my monday run: my garmin said I ran 5.07km, where as the app said I ran 5.35km. My run yesterday was 5.17km on my Garmin but 5.50km in the app. This is inline with earlier runs where the bigger the distance ran, the bigger the difference.


So I checked google maps and mapmyrun for the ""actual"" distance and this was closer in line with the app then with the Garmin. In fact, it was a bit farther then the app measured, but that could have been that i cut some corners.


A 280m and a 330m difference on a roughly 5k run seems a lot to me. Has anyone else experienced this? If so is there a way to fix this? I know its not the firmware as that is updated weekly and its been off since the start. Maybe I need to calibrate it?",2019-04-12

I was wondering how much more precise is the tracking from the Fenix series, if you don't require GPS? Is the heart rate monitor significantly better?  Right now, as far as I can see, the benefits of the Fenix series is primarily if you do outdoor sports where you can record your route and have music on your wrist without your phone.

Supposedly, if I spent most of the time indoors, would the Fenix even be a significant upgrade?

1,Give me a reason to not to buy Fenix 5s Plus,"Dear community, I currently own a Forerunner 645M + HRM-Run, can't complain about anything at all, watch does everything I want and need (the only drawback for me is that training status and load is for running only and I do lots of indoor HIITs, trails and stuff that isn't included in this). The main reason I started looking for a new watch (had AW3 previously) was that I randomly saw a Fenix 5s plus and was insantly wowed! It made me do a little research and found out I could get way more stats and data than my AW is giving me. I loved the Fenix 5s+, not so much the price. So I came over F645M that does everything I need for half the price of Fenix. Also I have very tiny wrist and the Fenix is pretty bulky and heavy. Yet I still like the watch. Other factor is I don't need topomaps, like at all, can't find out a situation where I could possibly use it. So I got the Forerunner and was happy with it for solid 4 months until my family gifted me money for my birthday. And I can't figure out a present for myself. Now the Fenix watch came to my mind. And I rationally know I don't need it. 


I run and do HIIT and weights regularly, sometimes yoga, swimming or SUP. I listen to music on my runs, yet I carry a phone with me when I go alone to be able to share my location via LiveTrack. I could go for Fenix 5s but I'd lost the music and had to carry phone for every run :/. And also no Garmin pay. Not like my bank would support it and looks like they don't even think about implementing it. But still.


So I need you! I need to find a valid reason to not to be spoiled. Main reasons against Fenix 5s+ are: probably too big and heavy, don't need it (especially maps). But it's such a beautiful device. Now if can anyone give me a punch I'd be so grateful! Or any other excuse like there's Fenix 6 coming out next week :D. I have literally zero reasons to upgrade except I like the watch more (I even bough my Forerunner a white band to make it look more like Fenix :D).",2019-04-16

4,Preferred watch for daily use?,"I been using a Fenix 5 for almost around a year now and I love it! The thing is the watch is way too heavy IMO for daily use, I can’t wear it while sleeping or while working can be cumbersome and noticeable. I had a Fitbit Charge 2 before switching to Garmin and I picked it up recently and the difference is very noticeable, the Fenix 5 is 85 grams and the Charge 2 39 grams, wearing the charge I barely notice it.


I’m looking into getting a watch that I’d wear when I’m around the house, going to sleep or working, maybe take it out for a walk and keep using the Fenix for my runs and weightlifting and also when I go out since it’s a nice watch. I’m a bit torn about the vivosmart 4 though because I read the screen is not that great, you can’t change the straps, and I while I like the form factor and weight (It only weights 18 grams!) I find the screen way too small! I wish it had the Charge 2 size.


The other option is a vivoactive 3, which would be nice since it supports music (fenix 5 doesn’t) and it’s light almost the same as the charge 2, however it’s double the price of a vivosmart and I like the idea of a band form factor rather than having another round clock.


The final option is to keep using the charge 2 for daily stuff, but now I have info on garmin and fitbit app and it’s not very convenient

I am a runner. I do some biking (not much). I am not a swimmer. I know the 735XT is ""built"" for triathletes, but I seem to be drawn to it anyway. I have been wearing a Garmin Vivoactive HR for the past two-plus years. Although it's not fancy, I love it. It's done me plenty good. I use it for running (races, easy runs, trail runs, and workouts), lifting weights, playing Ultimate Frisbee (running), and hockey. The golf feature has come in hand a few times, too. Nowadays, I don't have much time to play golf though. My main complaint about the Vivoactive HR is that it doesn't offer an exact pace time, as it really only displays the current pace-time as accurate as five seconds.


Recently, I've really began to enjoy running again. I'm 34 and spent the whole winter training and challenging myself. I am currently low/mid 37s for 10kms, on pace for a sub 1:20 half, and looking to break 3 hours for a full marathon in the near future.


In my opinion, I seem to enjoy everything about the 735XT. I am accustomed to the wrist-based HR. The thing that might intrigue me the most is the Virtual Pacer. I really think it's a pretty cool feature. At the moment, I'm looking to purchase a new watch very soon. My big race is coming up next Saturday and I want to be able to rely on an accurate pace time as much as possible... I want to see 4:09, 4:10, 4:11 exactly throughout the entire race.

Open the Garmin Connect Mobile application.

Go down to 'Garmin devices' and select this.


Click on your device and the 3 dots on the corner then select 'Remove device' and 'yes' .


Come out of the Garmin connect App and remove it from the phone.


Go into the settings of the phone and select 'Bluetooth'.


Under Bluetooth it will state 'My devices' and 'Devices available'. Under 'My devices' please remove and 'forget' anything listed under this section.


Next turn the Bluetooth off and then the mobile phone off.


Turn the mobile phone on and go back to settings and turn the Bluetooth back on.

My workout is a running interval.  The workout title has no special characters.  Up until the recent update I could program a workout into my calendar in connect on my android, tap 'send to device', sync the app and the workout would appear when I opened 'run' on my Fenix.


Does anyone else have this problem or a solution?

2,Looking for a new sports watch,"I have a FR235 today, and want to update it a bit. It works very well, but i want something that looks and feels a bit modern, if that makes sense (maybe a stupid reason to get a new watch).
The problem is that theres hundreds of watches, almost all of them have se same features. I really don't know where to start.
Could you guys give me some tips on which models i should have a closer look at?
I'm gonna use it for the following:


-Running, mostly outdoor, but some indoor runs too (needs wrist HR monitor, and obviously GPS+Glonass)
-Weightlifting (not much need for a watch here, but i like to record my sessions)
-Connect to my iPhone for notifications etc. 
-Needs to have at least as good a battery as the FR235
-Needs to be waterproof
-General activity tracking (steps, sleep etc.)

4,Garmin 5k training coach program not progressing,"I'm interested to hear about other experiences with the 5k training coaches because mine is feeling pretty useless so far to be honest. 


I liked that it let me say I could already run for a few minutes at a time so it started me at intervals of running for like 3 minutes, instead of the 30 second intervals when I did the C25k program for the first time. It built up pretty quickly to running three 7 minute intervals, which was 21 minutes of running total.


But then for 3 weeks in a row it's just had me run 1 or 1.5 miles, which feels like 
less
 of a workout than when I was doing 7 minute intervals. I'm only running for like 9-15 minutes. I would really like to be running more than that!


At the end of every workout I mark that it was either ""moderate"" or ""easy."" I marked it as ""very easy"" today hoping that might help but it still set up my next workout to be just running 1 mile. This feels like a ridiculously slow pace to try to build up to a 5k.

Forerunner 45:




Bands are similar to current design. Won't work with quick fit bands


V02 Max is supported


Incident/Fall Detection


Stress tracking? (Yellow person with lightning bolt in head?)


Body Battery


New Heart Rate Sensor

Music is standard


Garmin Pay


New First Beat metrics/screen layouts




&#x200B;


Forerunner 245 and 245Music:




Bands appear to be standard/quick fit compatible


Training Status


Aerobic and Anaerobic training effect


Incident/Fall Detection


Stress tracking? (Yellow person with lightning bolt in head?)


Body Battery


New Heart Rate Sensor


Only 1 (shitty) image of the 245 Music, red stripe on the start/stop button vs Grey/Merlot on the base 245.


NO
 GARMIN PAY (well, no sign of it in these photos at least)




&#x200B;


&#x200B;


EDIT: The website also claims that the 45 and 245 are currently out of stock and will be available 4/27/2019


EDIT 2: Complete speculation, but after looking at the heart rate sensor for the Vivosmart 4 it looks almost identical to the 45 and 245. This makes me think we will see the Pulse OX sensor on all 3 units. But the 45 and 245 will probably be used similar to the Vivosmart 4 where it’s basically just helping to capture better sleep/recovery data. 


Vivosmart 4 sensor for reference.

I can click on the VO2max arrow and it will give me a stylized chart that doesn’t tell me anything useful. This is fine because VO2max has its own more useful menu, but training load does not give me any charts at all anymore. I look at this all the time.




In setting up my cycle log it prompted me to change my tabs, which I happily changed to things I use a lot (eg performance). But now I can’t find anywhere in the menus where I would see my calendar or my challenges. I don’t really need them as tabs, but I’d like to be able to check my challenges occasionally. Any idea where I can find them?

1,Trying to decide between vivosport and vivoactive HR. Thoughts?,"I am between a couple different fitness trackers from Garmin. I'm looking for 1. Heart rate monitor, 2. Music controls, 3.

A coworker has offered to sell me an older model of the vivoactive HR ( 
https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-v%C3%ADvoactive-Smart-Watch-Regular/dp/B01BKUB6BA

That's really all I do. 


From what I see, the 245 is pretty much a multisport watch now. And since I'm non-elite, and will never do an ultra, I assume it's perfect (I bought my 920xt used) and I do use an ANT+ Garmin chest strap HR monitor and also I do have the Dual-HR strap too, but that's neither here nor there). I also do biking but don't have any fancy power or cadence monitors of my Surly Steamroller. 


The 245 looks perfect and I think the Fenix or the 945 is a huge overshoot.

1,Too much information - I am lost with models,"Hey guys, i am fairly new to Fitness watches.  As the title says i am fairly lost with Garmin models, especially with the new models just came out. 


What i do:


- Cycling


- Swimming*


- Running


*I don't mind if i can't really use it for swimming. 


Today i use my Phone and a Polar H10 on the bike for hart rate tracking. As far as i understand the H10 (Ant+) will work with most watches today. It would be nice to let the phone at home or in the backpack and only use the watch.


I like a relatively small watch and don't want to spend a fortune (below 300$). So the 935/45 is out of reach for me.


Music would be a nice to have but not a must.


So what i came down to is the Forerunner 735XT, Vivoactive 3 Music or may wait for the FR245?

1,Forerunner 45 vs 235,"Hi guys!


I've recently started running after having had knee issues for many years. I did a couch 2 5k program last years and now I'm frequently running 5k's at pretty low speeds. I've used endomondo with a chest strap so far but I'm looking at getting a running watch to get more data without needing a subscription, and to be able to glance at my progress while running.


I was planning on getting a 235 due to the low price but I waited for the new generation of watches, and got a bit turned off by the price point of thr 245. At the same time, I know I'll become nerdy pretty quickly and will want to see all kinds of data to analyze my progress, in other sports as well.


So ny question is, would the forerunner 45 be a step down from the 235 or are they roughly equal, with the 245 taking a step up? I don't want the 235 due to the age, but I don't want to pay more for a worse clock. It's really down to the 245 vs the 45, but to understand if the 45 is worth to buy I think I need to understand how it stands against the former obvious choice for me.


I'm leaning towards the 245 to be safe for the future, but if the 45 is equal to the 235 feature wise it might be great bang for the buck to me.


Edit:
Since the price was the biggest issue with the 245, I ordered directly when I found a 10% Discount code. I can live with spending more money if it'll last longer.

I charged it up today and did a soft reboot holding the left button down for 15 seconds till off, then hitting the same button to turn it back on. Beyond that, is there anything else I can do? Has the watch software itself been updated recently?  If so would it have happened automatically?

So yeah, I've set a couple KOMs on Strava with the Versa. I know for a fact they're not legit since my riding partner was ahead of me and their time would be ~30 seconds slower when checking the leaderboard, which had me ahead of the real KOM holder by 15-20 seconds. My average speed is around 15-16 mph, so you can see that I'm not that fast to begin with.   


For the meantime I've been using my Note 9 and the Strava app. Seems fine to me but man I love wearing a watch since I don't feel comfortable strapping my non insured phone to my stem LOL.   


I saw I can get a Vivoactive 3 Music on my Verizon plan, so that's an option if I need to get something else. Or is my Vivoactive non HR good enough with its own GPS to avoid setting these strange times? I have no experience with the VA since I got the Versa a few months before I got my first real road bike and just used the Versa the whole time. Only until recently did I start pursuing the KOMs on Strava, but what a bummer to see my times aren't legit.

1,Does anyone know how data is processed?,"Talking about sleep data. 


The watch acquires data, processes it to an extent, and it displays it right when we open the Garmin Connect phone app in the morning.


The readings, at that moment, are generally OK (it triggers sleep too quick too early but ok, that’s a known issue).


However after 2 hours, when I check my sleep stats these are greatly inflated. Fall asleep time is missed even more on the early side, and wake up time gets often expanded beyond actual wake up time as I’m chilling in the sofa having my morning coffee.


Sometimes up to two hours more than initially stated.


So my question is: is there a back and forth between the Garmin Connect App and some Garmin Server that processes (erroneously) the sleep data and sends it back to the app -for a complete miss, much greater than before?

are there any good weight lifting apps that are worth it?




can I sync with myfitnesspal to combine exercise & food to get a good daily view? Can I display calories remaining between the two apps ok? Can I show this as a detail on the main face?

I'm looking to get my first sports watch. My plan was at first to get a forerunner 235, but decided to wait for the new forerunners. I'm having a hard time choosing because i'm clueless. I have no idea what a smart watches are capable of, and most reviews doesnt seem to go thru the most basics, argubly most importent features :D


&#x200B;


Anyway... I want a watch that can do this:


Good battery life


Easy readable digital time for workouts


Connectivity for HR chest straps


Sound alerts


Excellent interval timer (ideally able to beep at specific times, like when to stop running etc)


I'd also love to be able to see how fast i'm running, but thats not necessary

3,Forerunner 245 Race Predictor,"My new Forerunner 245 has race predictions that are far too slow - even in the second half of a run the other day, I ran the last 5k over a minute faster than the watch's 5k race prediction. It seems to me like a performance faster than the prediction would override the prediction itself.


&#x200B;


I understand that the predictions will probably get more accurate as the watch gathers more data, but has anyone else experienced this? From what I have seen, the problem is usually the other way around with the race predictor. For what it's worth, previous training/races were recorded with a Forerunner 25, so no historical heart rate data from before the 245 is available for the watch to analyze.",2019-05-09
3,Thinking about purchasing Vivomove HR,I currently have a Fitbit flex 2 and I like it because of its simplicity and discreetness. But it’s starting to not hold a charge and dies more frequently. I was searching for a tracker that is sleek and doesn’t have a screen and I came across the Vivomove HR. I love that it looks like a analog watch and has a small hidden screen. I’ve been searching for some reviews but they don’t go too in depth. Does anyone happen to have one and feel like sharing their thoughts? Definitely give pros and cons because it is pretty pricey.,2019-05-09

I’m looking for one that does the things I love about my Fitbit-like great sleep tracking (including naps), continuous HR monitoring, auto exercise detection. I was looking at the Forerunner 945 since it just came out and should have the latest and greatest tech from Garmin but reading a lot about the reviews it looks like people comparing the between the two brands (Garmin and Fitbit) give more credit to the latter when it comes to daily tracking of HR, steps and sleep. I’m not an avid runner, I moderately exercise but I enjoy cycling and trekking so the GPS and altimeter/barometer would help. However since this would be my only wearable device I want to make sure it’ll make me happy overall in terms of data accuracy and not only when I exercise.

2,Watch Purchasing Advice: Garmin or Samsung (details inside),"Hello everyone,


could you please recommend me a Garmin watch, based on this criterias:


- I'm not much in a fitness side of things, do some workouts, but not crazy about statistics, aside from HR monitoring and cycling stats


- I'd like to use it for hiking (planning and following routes, barometer, altimeter, storm alarms and etc)


- This one is harder: I'd like to be able to show only certain notifications (with vibration alert). Do not care about FB or Instragram when hiking, but appreciate messages and calls notifications. Also, I use blood glukose monitoring system from Abbot, that pairs with my phone and can display notification alerts, when blood glukose is going under / over set threasholds. This is very important for me to be able to get this notifications on hikes.


Currently I'm using Samsung Gear S2 Classic which shows it's age already, and I'm not happy in terms of a sensors it has, and a battery life (get max 2 days now).


Watches that I consider buying is: Samsung Galaxy Watch  (similar / familiar UI, more sensors, but hiking features and battery life might be not that good still) or some of the Garmins (Instinct is a top choice yet, but looking at Forerunners too since I can install maps via Connect IQ).

I would consider the watch to be in like-new condition, no scratches or wear. A great watch with lots of features, but I've decided I need something more rugged. The watch is light and comfortable to wear and sleep in and charges very fast.


As the title says, this is the Verizon version of the vivoactive 3 Music watch. It can be activated with Verizon to allow you to send and receive text messaged directly from the watch and enable Garmin LiveTrack without lugging your phone along. It also allows you to setup emergency contacts to that you can send a message in case of emergency just by holding the button for several seconds, great piece of mind for solo runners.


I'm really interested in a Garmin Instinct in black or white, and would be willing to trade.

That said I am forever injuring myself so I think running metrics in the future would be helpful. 


I'm essentially after these things:




Track my HR and distance cycling and running


When hiking I will mostly navigate using a map and compass however leaving a breadcrumb trail for safety should we need it to track back and getting a 6 figure grid reference would also be nice. I think battery life is key here and the longer the better


Some form of navigation, I think I would like to start trail running at some point and ski touring so having some form of navigation would nice. However it seems to be really confusing exactly what navigation features are supported on what watches


Something small I have small wrists and I like my watch to be understated




I have tried on the VA3 and 645 and I like the size. I found the 935 and Fenix 5s a bit to big. Annoyingly I can get the Fenix 5s/5 for about the same price as the 935/645 through a work scheme.

I just got a Fenix 5 and have come from using a Pebble Watch. I have an iPhone as well. My main question is that with my Pebble, I was able to have my phone on Do not Disturb and not receive notifications on my phone but still get notifications on my watch. This made sense to me as that way only the watch would vibrate and my phone would be silent. Then whenever I did not have my watch on me, I could deactivate Do not Disturb and my phone would then vibrate like normal. I am wondering if there is anything similar for Garmin. Currently, if I turn on Do not Disturb, I do not get notifications on either my watch or phone. However when Do not Disturb is off, both my phone and watch vibrate and light up which is annoying. Is there any way to remedy this? Additionally, is there any way to control what notifications are sent to the watch?

I'm new to the Garmin world; bought a FR935 about 3 weeks ago, then the FR945 was announced a week later, so I REI-exchanged the 935 for the 945 with minimal guilt. (I almost never return things, keeping the money in the co-op by exchanging rather than just returning, and I buy from them specifically to make my life easier if I'm not happy). 


I'm happier with the 945 generally; the screen looks much crisper even though supposedly the resolution is the same -- maybe just the font smoothing or something. I don't like the stacked time display on the default face QUITE as much, though I figure I can fix that somehow. I like the additional space it frees up to display more content though.


But, speaking of that content, the sunset thing makes no sense. First of all, it doesn't seem to start counting down until the afternoon (eg, it stays at the 'beginning' end of the range until midday). So I thought maybe it only started counting down from the highest peak. Fine. But in the past few days I've noticed it doesn't seem to update at all sometimes -- it'll show hours left when it's dark, and so on. Any thoughts?


Also, the buttons seem... sub-par. Start/stop is perfect. Back/lap seems perfect.


""down"" has 2, sometimes 3 detents to trigger (like a camera shutter button you can depress halfway). ""Up"" sometimes seems clicky, sometimes squishy. The ""light"" button isn't quite as precise-feeling as I'd like. From what I can recall, the buttons were perfect on my 935. To be honest, it doesn't bother me THAT much, and if this was my first Garmin, I'd probably not have thought twice about it, but the comparison makes it pretty stark. Ideas? I'd rather not return it for such a silly ""issue"", particularly because I've already returned the 935, and I feel like REI already did right by me. thanks!",2019-05-16

1,Vivoactive 3 reset - won’t connect to phone,"So, we recently got my mom a vivoactive 3; which was connect to the Garmin app on her iPhone and everything was working fine. 


I don’t know how
, but somehow she hit a “restore to default” button on the watch. And now it won’t connect to the phone. We still have her logged in to her Garmin app on the phone and there doesn’t seem to be any problem with the app aside from it not syncing with the watch. 
The error message on the phone was “enable Bluetooth on your vivoactive 3 and on your iOS device”. Bluetooth is ‘on’ on the phone. 


When we go into the watch; we go to “settings” then to “phone”. But it doesn’t give an option to turn the Bluetooth on or off. It just tries to automatically cannot to the phone; which displays the same error message that we need to turn the watch Bluetooth on and the same problem cycles again. 


Any help or suggestions is appreciated.

1,Adding hr zone graph to data fields,"Hey,


So I'm on a Forerunner 645M and lookimg for an option to add the hr zone graph to the same screen as for example pace or distance. Like a screen with 3 data fields - top half hr zones, bottom pace and distance. I know you can put the zones on separate 1-field screen, I know that apps like DozenRun etc show colorcoded zones aswell, I'm just trying to figure out if it's possible without tinkering or adding Connect IQ stuff.

This watch is supposed to last 7 days and 13 hours in gps mode.... I haven't used the GPS? 
The instructions and tutorial for this watch is utterly crap so perhaps I'm doing something wrong?

43,Shout Out to Garmin Customer Service,"I'm a vivomove hr owner, and I love my watch.  It's exactly what I want out of a smartwatch -- an analog look, long battery life, and digital notifications.  It dresses up reasonably and tracks fitness reasonably.  But on Thursday, I almost gave up on Garmin.


I was out cutting my lawn, and I put the watch in my pocket to at least get my steps counted.  When I came in and took my watch out of my pocket, it was in Portuguese.  And the date had advanced by 8 days.  And the time had advanced by 5 hours.  And my steps, which should have been around 8,000, were stuck at 1,044.


I was super disappointed.  I googled around, found no similar situations, and said to my wife ""I should have just bought an Apple watch.""  I decided I'd give Garmin customer service a try, not knowing whether I'd get quality help or some horrific Comcast-like experience.


When I called customer service, they had me install Garmin Express on my Mac.  I did, and then when I rebooted my Mac, it died.  I'm running an upgraded mid 2010 MacBook Pro -- I've sunk a lot of dollars into the machine and intend to run it until it's totally dead (which I accept could be any day now).  So when I rebooted and got an error log the size of Michigan and a notification that said ""Operating System install failed,"" you can imagine my reaction.  I tried to stay calm (and my customer service agent remained calm) despite my broken Mac and broken watch. I went over to my wife's MacBook Air to try to install the software.   I lifted the lid, and nothing.  I banged the power key, nothing.  It was plugged into its charger and d-e-a-d dead.


At this point, I'm thinking this is either a dream or the Russians .  My watch was in an alternate, stepless, space-time, my Mac had no OS, and my wife's Mac was dead (which meant I would soon be dead, too).


I eventually got my Mac to boot (I'm typing this long post on it now!), and my rep with Garmin helped me reset the watch and remove corrupted files from its file system.  Apparently my watch was attempting to sync a file to my phone, and the sync failed, and the watch then went crazy-go-nuts.  After the reset, the watch was again working perfectly (and has continued to work perfectly since Thursday). This morning I even got my wife's Air booting in Safe Boot -- so I'm almost through my personal technological apocalypse.  


Thanks to Kevin and the Garmin customer service team for fixing my watch and keeping me sane while every device I touched died. They spent 70 patient minutes with me -- a customer who has no history with them or loyalty to them.  Or at least didn't until that phone call.


TLDR:  My watch went psycho, I called customer service.  While on the phone with Kevin at Garmin, my Mac died and then my wife's Mac died.  I got my Mac to boot and he remained calm and focused and got my watch fixed.  Thanks to Kevin and the Garmin Customer Service team!",2019-05-18

I've paired the watch to the new phone.  But I don't seem to have access to any historic data?  I went to manage Garmin account and logged in with same details, then synced.  I was assuming my data would be stored by Garmin and would be restored to the phone.

4,"New to Garmin watches, picked up the Vívoactive 3, right choice?","Looking for some input.  Decided to take better care of myself physically, so in addition to better eating, started exercising with elliptical running for around 45 minutes each day.  Decided on Garmin after reading reviews for about a day and picked up the VA3 in slate.  I like the smaller size, so I’ll probably stay at 45 or smaller.  I’ve only worn it for about 2 days so far and I like it so far, but undecided if I made the right choice.


I’m admittedly a beginner to running.  I don’t see myself running outdoors often, if at all.  I do want to eventually challenge myself to do a 5k, but due to a work schedule and having kids, I don’t have the time and safety to run outdoors, so I’m restricted to elliptical and treadmill work.  I also plan on just doing basic exercising at the gym with weights and running around and playing with my kids.  So I’d want something comfortable and I plan on wearing it 24/7 outside of a few hours at the office when I can charge.


Overall I like the VA3 but already I can see many of the issues with the touch screen and having only one button.  Wearing it in the shower and it went crazy.  Wearing it while swimming with the kids yesterday and same thing.  Also having a touch screen (decently responsive) makes operation slower than I think it needs to be.


I want something I can use effectively now and grow into the next 1-3 years.  I’m not making it like this will be my last option and want it to last for 10 years but also don’t want to spend for things that me being a beginner won’t fully utilize.  


With that being said, I’m looking at two models in addition to just also just sticking with the VA3.  




245 non-music 


235 (not sure if the 245 is worth the extra?)


735 XT (not sure what’s so different about this one)


the new 45 and grow into it.




Or I could just keep the VA3 right now and stop over analyzing it.  I’m sure I could get used to the touch screen interface if given enough time with it.


I’d love some thoughts.


Edit:


I appreciate all of the assistance and insights from everyone.  Found out I could get 30% off the Forerunner 245 non-music and stacked it with 4% cash back with ebates, so ended up with it for $223 after tax, which is less than the VA3 I picked up.  Both would do great for me and I’m sure the VA3 would’ve done 100% of what I needed but seems like for the same price (in my case $10 less) it’s a no brainer to get more for the money.",2019-05-20

Currently I have a Garmin 220 for running and a Vivosmart 3 for fitness tracking.  I like the stats of the Garmin 245, and also the fitness tracking features.  The Garmin 645 has more features for runners (such as the barometric altimeter), but is $100 more.  I'm thinking the altimeter may be overrated.

2,FR235 in 2019?,"Hi all,


&#x200B;


I am a casual runner looking to lose a bit of weight and just get a bit fitter. I'm looking for a Garmin watch after hearing nothing but positive things from friends and family who have the devices. I'm looking at the FR235, as I've found a great deal on it new (£127 after some discounts!), however I'm a bit cautious as I'm aware it's a few years old. Are Garmin likely to set the sun on this device soon in terms of support, etc?


Other than running, I'll be using it for general day-to-day stuff, like step tracking, and treating it as my everyday watch. 


&#x200B;


I have looked at other possibilities:


- FR35 - a bit too bland for my liking. Part of the appeal of the 235 is the customisation. 


- FR45 - would be PERFECT for a casual runner like me, but obviously this is quite new and there aren't enough reviews to back it up yet. 


- Vivoactive 3 - haven't read great things (lots of Amazon reviews complaining about it crashing and stuff), and I'm not really sold on the touch screen. 


&#x200B;


So I guess the Tl;dr is: Is the FR235 too outdated? Am I better off with something else? 


Opinions are greatly appreciated - maybe I've missed a device completely that would be perfect? Really open to any thoughts.

I ended up using OpenAudible to rip to mp3 instead. I was then able to copy to the watch via USB to the audiobooks folder. I copied 2 for testing.

I have a Fitbit Charge 3 and I have a few major issues with its display. There is no way to turn on an ""always on"" display mode (or an ""always on during workout"" mode, for that matter), meaning if I'm in the middle of an intense running/bike workout I often have to repeatedly do the wrist-turn thing to get its display to turn on, which can range anywhere to an annoyance to downright dangerous as it is distracting me from looking where I'm running towards. The workout display text size is also very small and it's extremely hard to read while running, meaning I can't easily tell how far I'm going or how long I've been running. Last, the display brightness sucks and if I'm exercising outside in the sunlight it makes the display even harder to read, coupled with the small text size.


I've been looking at the Vivoactive 3 or other Garmins in that price range, but wanted to make sure it would actually be an improvement on these problems. Does it have an always on setting? Is the text size/brightness during an outdoors workout sufficient enough that it's easily readable at a quick glance while running? Thank you!",2019-05-25

3,"Got new VO2 max, it's now gone...?","Hello,


so on Tuesday lunch break I went for my usual short 5k run, I ran it in a record time and also my watch (Fenix 5s+) registered new VO2 max. I was pretty excited about it since I haven't seen the number move for weeks. So I took a screenshot in the Connect app too and also noticed my race predictor updated to even crazier numbers. Anyway today I randomly messed up with the watch and saw the new VO2 max isn't there anymore, it's showing the same number as previously and also the race predictor was back at original values. I thought maybe I got worse again so I checked the Connect but there's no sign of the level going down. The line is flat without any spike that would prove there was the number I have on my screenshot! Am I getting crazy? 


Since the 5k record on Tuesday, I was out running intervals on Thursday - 5k with 200m sprint and 800m regular tempo - I ended up with almost the same time and pace as on Tuesday so it definitely wasn't such a bad run. Yet it's possible it got me to my previous level of VO2 max but why the Tuesday number isn't visible in the graph in Connect app?!",2019-05-25

2,80/20 HR Zones,"Hello there,


&#x200B;


I have been following an 80/20 running plan which has 7 custom running zones, defined as Z1, Z2, Zone X, Z3, Zone Y Z4, Z5.

I'm trying to update my HR zones in Garmin Connect and there is only option to use 5 zones. I was just wondering if anyone else followed this plan and knew a way to get my zones in Garmin to match (or the best way to work around this so I'm making sure to follow the correct intensity)?

4,"Help? New to fitness trackers, bit overwhelmed.","So, I'm a serious weightlifter with a crappy cardiovascular capacity wanting to improve.


With that said, I'm looking for something that mainly tracks my workouts (indoor running and swimming and weightlifting), steps, calories burned, HR and sleep. I don't need a smartwatch or anything fancy that counts reps/laps or storages music. I actually just like the cool stats (since they hold me accountable) and want them to be as accurate as possible. Also, I don't really care if it's touchscreen or not.


At first, I went straight to the Fitbit Versa, but the reviews of that watch are just terrible and it looks more like a stylish watch than a actual fitness-focused tracker... A few people on Amazon suggested Garmin as the better tracker. But there are so many options!


I'm looking at Garmin's Canadian website right now and there are three trackers around the same price range ($280-300): FR45, FR235 and VA3. They look pretty similar to me, except for the fact that the last two are 2/3 years old and that the VA3 looks more like a multi-sport device (please do correct me if I'm wrong). Also, the FR35 is on sale for $170.


Should I go for the VA3 because of the weightlifting/swimming stuff (although I can count my reps/laps) or the FR cause I just need the tracking info? And if I go for the FR, is the 235 still better than the new 45? Is the FR35 really outdated compared to the other three I mentioned?


Thanks in advance!


Edit: I know about the FR245 and it looks amazing, but it's more than $400. I'm not Canadian (here just for travel) and the currency conversion makes it waaaay more expensive than my budget :(",2019-05-26

Sync




I went for a run before I ticked the data consent to sync to my phone. Now the run won't sync at all. I've tried to add fresh activities to persuade the earlier run to sync but the new one does but not the old one. This is very frustrating. 


The run is showing in the watch but not the Connect App. 




WiFi




I cannot get the device to accept my home WiFi connection. Used the same password copied and pasted that worked fine on my phone. Set up a mobile hotspot on my mobile and the watch connected perfectly fine so there's nothing wrong with the chip on the device. The only difference is that the hotspot password is all lower case and the router is upper and lower case.

The 820 is obviously the newest version of the 810 and I've read that the 830 has been released/will be released soon, causing the price of the 820 to drop. Is it worth waiting for that or are there other options that you would recommend?

The doesn't matter to me, the real reason for using this is just getting the data into the Garmin Connect app. I use the ErgIQ app downloaded to my watch. Anyway, after rowing I get to work and take a look on my phone and I see this data.. 66 Strokes. Calories Burned 61. Avg HR 96 and Time 10 mins. Now, the only data field that is correct is the time. Everything else is not even close. Maybe the 66 strokes means average? Not sure. Calories.. not sure that's even close. Avg heart rate is really perplexing because I had my Polar strap on and that was also synced to the PM5 and I could see it throughout my workout, and my average was definitely in the 135 range for 10 mins.

Having bought a good number of Garmin watches and devices over the years I’ve never seen this before. 


Turning the Edge 530 on it was ready for setup, but a factory reset could have achieved that. 


It’s a new model and I had trouble finding stock of the unit on its own - wasn’t in the premium pack or MTB pack - so I’d be surprised if they’re sending our returns already. 


It works fine and there doesn’t appear to be any damage that I can see. But as I paid for new I wanted new. If it was used I’d expect a few £s off the price.

2,FR245 heart-rate from HRM strap for activities where you can't wear the watch,"Hi!


I recently bought a FR245, and I want to record my heart rate during indoor climbing, but for obvious reasons I am not wearing the watch while climbing/bouldering. My ingenius idea was to buy a HR strap, wear the strap during climbing, and leave my FR245 20 meters away in the bag. I must not be the only one that does activities where they can't wear the watch, but would love to record the activity, heart-rate, training effect etc.?


It doesn't seem easy to find out though whether or how this can work. The only way to know seems to buy both the HRM-TRI and HRM-Dual and try it out, which is not really a good option, for obvious money reasons.


ANT+ has a very low range. The HRM-TRI has a cache though and ""offline-sync"". Apparently this does not only work in Swim/OWS activities, but it works for all activities. I found out that Swim/OWS ""offline-HR"" is only supported on the expensive models (e.g. 935/945). But there are forum posts saying that offline-sync HR works on the FR235, for *non-swim* activities (not for OWS/Swim-HR though, for which you need the more expensive watches). It doesn't seem to work on the 645 though.


So - how about the FR245? Also my scenario doesn't need full offline/after-activity sync, since I could be in range of the watch every few minutes or so during the activity. I could not find any information online about that scenario.


Another idea I had was to buy a HRM strap with Bluetooth LE, which would only be the HRM-Dual from Garmin. BLE might have a larger range than ANT+, and so what I want to do could work, even without HR cache in the strap, if the BLE range is large enough? (Unfortunately the HRM-Dual doesn't have Running Dynamics though which would be a shame).

I'm interested in running power as well. I see this is not supported on the 245, but if I'd combine the 245 with a Stryd footpod I suppose I'd get the same (or better) functionality as a 945 with a Garmin RD pod, right?.

3,"Time to upgrade my watch, or pay to have it serviced?","Hey r/Garmin , 


&#x200B;


I currently have the Fenix 3 HR and have had it since Cyber Monday of 2016. For the last couple of months I have been having some issues with the watch and yesterday I was able to reach out to Garmin for support. I was informed that after doing a ""full hard reset"" and the problems still occurring, the next step would be to send it in for a software update/repair. The cost of this repair will be $130. 


&#x200B;


I was wondering if you guys think that this is a smart move or if you think I would be better off upgrading? I have been looking at the Fenix 5 and it seems almost identical with a few minor upgrades and improvements. 


&#x200B;


Here are the issues I have been having: 




Sleep data not tracking (Although the accuracy can vary anyway, this one is important to me)


Alarms intermittently not chiming 


Wrist HR intermittently not working (during activities and resting)


IQ app not functioning properly 


I did reach out to the developer on this one and he/she stated that there apparently isn't enough memory on the Fenix 3 HR for their app to function correctly. Unfortunately, this is the activity that I use the most (it's for bouldering/rock climbing) and I would like to be able to track my workouts and progress








&#x200B;


I have read up on Reddit and the Garmin forums looking for solutions to these issues and none of them have worked for me.

Thanks for any advice in advance!",2019-05-30
6,FR945 as a backpacking watch?,"Hi all,


TL;DR - 945 or Fenix 5 Plus?


A question from someone considering the jump to Garmin* -


Backstory: About 2-3 times a year, I go out on backpacking trips (3-4 days each) + day hikes/overnighters throughout the year - you won't find me in some exotic northface commercial locale, but the locations can get tough and I usually get banged up -


At home, I primarily run, but also am thinking of getting a bike to increase variety. Triathlons have always intrigued me, but I've never made any concrete steps towards doing one (though would like to).


A few days ago, I actually pulled the trigger on the Fenix 5x Plus (REI sale, etc.), but ended up returning it because it was just too massive - but the features, build, and quality stood out - I was going to go back and grab the 5 Plus, but saw the 945 came out - and they're more or less the same price at this point... with the 945 picking up some cool features like acclimation, pulse ox (the 5 plus doesn't have this), and training load whatever.


However, when one goes to Garmin's website, they tend to market the 945 as a triathlon watch with an emphasis on road running - if you tap on their Hiking/Backpacking watches, they really only recommend the Fenix.


Build quality and durability are important to me - I'm a 100% believer in sapphire glass - I've owned a few Seiko's whose faces are impeccable because of that glass. However, I've been using an Apple Watch Series 2 for the past 3 years, and the Ion-X screen has performed admirably in the above activities I do. Definitely some scratches, but that's character. 


Any thoughts on the FR945 as a backpacking watch? If not for the build materials, I wouldn't hesitate for a second to get it over the 5 Plus - I really don't have any experience with Garmin so if folks could speak to the build quality, that would be great.

So my choices are the FR35 which is on sale at the moment-  half the price of the new 45s and meets my basic running needs. But i like the style of the FR45s more (looks less bulky than the 35) and the updated features, but it is expensive.


The main things i want is a resonable gps accuracy , good battery life,  running and other workout details and music control.


So is it better to pick an old FR35 that meets my basic needs or pick FR45S where it has the latest features and it looks better.",2019-05-31

2,Foreruner 235 or 45?,"First post here, so please be gentle.


I've been rocking my FR25 for some years now, but as I'm starting to train for my first half marathon (which is in October), I'm looking to upgrade my watch.


The FR235 caught my eye as it gives me two things I really need right now: a HRM on the wrist and way faster GPS lockdown (the FR25 sometimes takes ages). It would also give me tons of new metrics, which I'm going to have to find my way around them as they're new to me. However, the FR45 just came out and now I'm struggling to decide which one to buy: the FR45 seems to have a more updated hardware, but, if I'm correct, gives me less data than the FR235. Now, the FR235 is a bit outdated, but the FR235 and FR45 are around the same price point where I live.


Now I'm really struggling to decide which one to buy: I believe both watches are a good fit; the FR235 would give me some more data but the FR45 might last longer hardware-wise.


So, dear r/Garmin, would you give me an honest opinion on which watch I should go for?

I am going to order my first Garmin soon and thus I want to know few things about this device which are as follows:  




Can we track triathlons with VA3M using some app or do we have inbuilt feature?




How is the battery life going for the daily users and tracking running 5 days a week?




I usually exercise with my friends and we do all kinds of exercises like cardio, planks, squats, burpee etc. So can the device automatically detects the exercises or atleast recognize that I am doing exercises?




Since this device has a touch screen, is it responsive under water while swimming?






5.1. The device has a hardened glass only.. So should we use a screen protector and is it useful in case of watch getting dropped?


5.2. Also, if we use a screen protector, how much touch screen responsiveness has been lost?


I hope these queries can be easily answered by the users who are using their device as a daily driver.


*****Also, any suggestion you would like to give will be highly appreciated!!!!!


Please respond as I am going to order it soon (excited!!)
