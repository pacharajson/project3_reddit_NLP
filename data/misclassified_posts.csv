"Best  apps for working out at the gym? I'm referring to physical activities like weight lifting, plyometrics, crossfit, yoga, or any other activity not listed in (excluding ""other"") the built-in workout app.The default app is quite awful as far as display options. There are 3 fields. Top field displays current time or elapsed time. Middle field ONLY displays elapsed time (why even allow top field to display the same elapsed time?). Bottom field displays HR, Calories, or elapsed time. Again... elapsed time can be displayed in three fields...There's seemingly no ability to change the fields from the above (or add fields). There are no laps or lap times (e.g., for rest intervals). You can't edit a workout. (e.g., sometimes I forget to turn off the workout timer and remember a few minutes later. I'd rather save the workout at 1:00 hour rather than the 1:05 including the 5 minutes of idle activity)Worst of all, there's no option to keep the display on the entire workout. (I don't care about the expense to the battery.) I often have to wait longer to get a new HR measurement than the display shut off time.Clearly, the default app was not created by someone who has ever stepped foot in a gym.I'm looking for something that shows HR, overall time, rest intervals, etc., and addresses some of those problems above.(Note, I'm not interested in running apps, unless they can do the above.)",garmin,applewatch

"""Workaround"" for accurate calorie tracking Since the current method the   uses to track resting calories seems off (in my case, my  says my ""resting"" burn is 2570 calories every day, but I calculate my actual base metabolic rate [BMR] at 1810), I've found an alternate method of tracking caloric burn (for the purposes of weight management) that, based on a few weeks of data, seems to be much more accurate than whatever the heck it is that the Activity app shows.It requires that you use the   in conjunction with MyFitnessPal.Setup:In MyFitnessPal, use the ""Steps"" page on the More... screen to specify your  and Phone as your source of step dataCalculate your BMR (use a site like this one: http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/ )In MyFitnessPal, use the ""Goals"" page on the More... screen to set ""Calories"" (under Nutrition Goals) to your calculated BMR valueAlso on the ""Goals"" screen, make sure your current and goal weight are entered.In the Health app, go to Sources, select MyFitnessPal, and make sure that app is set up to read Weight, Steps, and Workout data.Method:Track your food intake in MyFitnessPal as you normally would. Let MyFitnessPal automatically read your steps and workout data from the  and Activity apps.MyFitnessPal will combine your activity level with your BMR value and give you a surprisingly accurate daily, goal-based target for your caloric intake (the calories ""Remaining"" value on the main screen)Using this method, MyFitnessPal gives me daily targets that precisely match my calculated Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) values. The ""daily burn"" listed in the Activity app remains way too high, meanwhile, and I am now ignoring it altogether. I just focus on meeting my daily move target, and let MyFitnessPal keep me on track with my diet.It works for me -- would love to hear if anyone else can replicate my success!EDIT -- TL;DR:The Activity app's ""resting calories"" value is too high, and you can't override the value  chooses for you. MyFitnessPal (and apps like it) let you pull the ""active calories"" data (which is accurate) from your  and add it to a ""resting""/BMR value that you can set. Ideally this value is based on the scientifically-sound, well-supported Harris-Benedict formula for BMR.The fix for  would be for them to correct their ""resting"" value OR let you override it with a value you calculate yourself.",garmin,applewatch
