"Virtual partner.. How do I do this?  I have a standard hike I do a few times a week.  I want to ""race"" that hike each time I do it, but I can't seem to find how to do it.  I can find the virtual pace setting where I tell it a time, but that's not what I want.  Ideally I would know if I was ahead or behind the same hike I choose from my history.",applewatch,garmin
"Manually add workout to Activity app? I apologize if this isn't the place for this, but it seemed like a good starting point.  If there's a better place for this question feel free to point me in that direction.I just got my watch today and I'd like to add the workout I did this morning (stationary bike) as well as add workouts later down the road  won't wear my watch for (like swimming) .  It appears there isn't a way to do this within the Health app or Activity tracker.  I've been using Jawbone's app but it doesn't write to the activity tracker.  Anyone happen to know of a 3rd party app that allows you to do this?",garmin,applewatch
"Best watch apps for working out at the gym? I'm referring to physical activities like weight lifting, plyometrics, crossfit, yoga, or any other activity not listed in (excluding ""other"") the built-in workout app.The default app is quite awful as far as display options. There are 3 fields. Top field displays current time or elapsed time. Middle field ONLY displays elapsed time (why even allow top field to display the same elapsed time?). Bottom field displays HR, Calories, or elapsed time. Again... elapsed time can be displayed in three fields...There's seemingly no ability to change the fields from the above (or add fields). There are no laps or lap times (e.g., for rest intervals). You can't edit a workout. (e.g., sometimes I forget to turn off the workout timer and remember a few minutes later. I'd rather save the workout at 1:00 hour rather than the 1:05 including the 5 minutes of idle activity)Worst of all, there's no option to keep the display on the entire workout. (I don't care about the expense to the battery.) I often have to wait longer to get a new HR measurement than the display shut off time.Clearly, the default app was not created by someone who has ever stepped foot in a gym.I'm looking for something that shows HR, overall time, rest intervals, etc., and addresses some of those problems above.(Note, I'm not interested in running apps, unless they can do the above.)",garmin,applewatch

"Bug related to Longest Move Streak achievement? So I realized that I stopped getting my longest move streak achievement today, and when I went to the activity app I couldn't figure out why it has stopped registering my move streak...

"How to get the g96 Mark Waypoint function to mark seconds? So the G96 owner's manual (http://www.garmin.com.ua/manuals/air/96_96C_OwnersManual.pdf) on page 31 shows HH:MM:SS when marking waypoints, however when using the device to mark my current location it is only displaying HH:MM. I'm using the G96 as a TSPI source and therefore not having seconds is detrimental to my data capture.Does anyone know how to reconfigure the G96 to show HH:MM:SS when marking current location as a waypoint?",applewatch,garmin
"if your wifi network is hidden,the apple watch might not connect when bluetooth is off so my wifi network at home is hidden , at first my apple watch would not connect to it when i turned bluetooth off on my iphoneto fix this i went into airport extreme  & made my wifi visible , that made apple apple watch connect to itnow i went back into airport extreme and made my wifi invisible again, i tested the apple watch with bluetooth off and the apple watch connected to my wifi, you can make calls and do all the others things but now you have wifi rangeso if your home and the apple watch doesn't connect to your wifi when bluetooth is off or your out of range, the problem could be this hidden wifi setting",garmin,applewatch

"Hue Lights with Activity app? Title.Just got some hue lights and saw some IFTTT recipes for Fitbit and UP fitness/sleep trackers, would it be possible to respond to the Activity app with the new update coming in the fall?For example changing to green when completing the exercise ring or cycling through a rainbow when completing all rings. Just a cool thought I had and wondered if it'd be possible!",garmin,applewatch
"Thinking of getting the forerunner 735xt. Any reviews? I'm a very happy amateur when it comes to distance events, but will be completing my first half iron man in September. My only thought is that after the event, I still play a lot of football/soccer. Would the watch also be useful for that, as it's definitely billed as a more triathlon focused watch...?",applewatch,garmin
"Has anyone heard of a plan to implement YNAB (You Need A Budget) on the AppleWatch? Some ideas I had would be to just have an apple that allows you to enter transactions.My other idea would be to use it like a trip budget.  Fill the budget (ie. Ynab Wallet) with x amount of money from a specific (or multiple) categories, then when entering transactions, they come out of that specific wallet/ category.This could be useful for anyone ever needing running totals.At the supermarket, shopping online, or even while on a road/day trip.Bad idea?",garmin,applewatch

"Notifications only on watch and not on Phone Hi guys,I just got a Fenix 5 and have come from using a Pebble Watch. I have an iPhone as well. My main question is that with my Pebble, I was able to have my phone on Do not Disturb and not receive notifications on my phone but still get notifications on my watch. This made sense to me as that way only the watch would vibrate and my phone would be silent. Then whenever I did not have my watch on me, I could deactivate Do not Disturb and my phone would then vibrate like normal. I am wondering if there is anything similar for Garmin. Currently, if I turn on Do not Disturb, I do not get notifications on either my watch or phone. However when Do not Disturb is off, both my phone and watch vibrate and light up which is annoying. Is there any way to remedy this? Additionally, is there any way to control what notifications are sent to the watch?Thanks,Brandon",applewatch,garmin

Can't get rid of incident detection notification in notification screen on edge 820 Firstly it's annoying that just simply stopping and your handlebars moving sideways is enough to set the damn thing off and you have to go through cancelling it twice but now I can't get rid of the notification from Sunday and it is really frustrating.,applewatch,garmin
Just ordered a 935 after two many ruined Apple watch runs. What features should I try out? My sleaves would end workouts on my apple watch.  Sweaty fingers or rain would ruin intervals as the touch screen would not respond.  What features should I test out on the 935?,applewatch,garmin
How long do your watch bands live? I have a 920XT that I wore pretty much all day everyday since January and the stock bands will probably kick the bucket soon. That's an estimated lifespan of 9 months. Are those numbers comparable across the board or do you experience different numbers?,applewatch,garmin

"So happy I finally decided to go for it and get the Fenix 3 HR last week and I can't contain myself. This watch is incredible. I've tried a FitBit, an Apple Watch, an Android Wear Watch and there was always some issue with them whether it was size, lack of functionality, battery life, you name it.I wish I had purchased this watch earlier this year, haven't been this happy with a tech purchase in years.",applewatch,garmin

"There was a problem communicating with your garmin device. Unable to install anything. Can anyone help? I let my garmin die the other day and when I charged it and turned it back on, the watch face was uninstalled. When I go to activity and management then watch faces the phone says loading, then gives that message I posted in the title. Sometimes it goes to the next screen that shows a bunch of watch faces uninstalled. None of them install on my garmin. When I attempt, it says transfer failed on the watch face. Anyone have any ideas on how to get my watch back to normal?Edit: reset the watch and same thing. Its connected and syncs. I just cant download anything to it",applewatch,garmin
