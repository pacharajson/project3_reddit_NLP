Checking to verify this combination will fit my needs.,"Hi all,I was pointed to Garmin devices by another subreddit and have been doing research, but because not many people are interested in my exact use-case, I'm not sure what combination of things will fit my exact need.I do strongman, and I lift in my garage. I want to wear a heart rate monitor (chest strap only: wrist based solutions do not handle HR spikes well) and want to stream data to something (ipad, iphone, macbook, PC are my available options within 5-50 feet.) I want to then export the data to a CSV file.I was looking at a Garmin heart rate monitor strap: http://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Premium-Heart-Monitor-Strap/dp/B00BI9X1QM/ref=pd_bxgy_422_img_3?ie=UTF8&refRID=08AZPYHASE82DB73RVXVIn combination with the ANT+ USB stick:http://www.amazon.com/Garmin-USB-Stick-Fitness-Devices/dp/B00CM381SQ/ref=pd_bxgy_422_img_3?ie=UTF8&refRID=190SAM3984XKBXF10TARWill this allow me to stream my heart rate to this device to be exported later as a CSV? I do not need to view my heart rate during my workouts, but being able to check it occasionally would be nice.Thanks for your time.",garmin
Garmin fenix 3,We need to do something this latest update 5.1 is destroying are batteries. By discharging all the way and make us charge them daily.

Smart Notifications question...?,"Hi all, I just had a quick question regarding Smart Notifications, specifically on the Fenix 3. It is my understanding that any phone notification can be sent over to the watch, which is great. My question is what are we able to do with those notifications via the watch?I know the watch is not a 'smart' watch in the way we have come to know and understand them, but I just wanted to know what's possible. For example, when getting an email, is it possible to read/delete/star/archive via the watch? Similarly, can other such messages from other apps, eg WhatsApp, be interacted with, for example responding with a stock message response? I have seen the watch has a calendar/schedule functionality (when paired with a phone). Is this limited to only showing the next 'appointment' on the watch or can one scroll through upcoming appointments too, and maybe even see a whole calendar view?I'm sure I'll have other questions but these are the main ones for me at the moment. Any info regarding the above would be much appreciated. Thank you.",garmin

VivoSmart vs VivoSmart HR?,"I've searched and searched, but I can't find a direct comparison between the original VivoSmart and the HR. Could anyone tell me the differences in features besides the obvious HR monitor?For a little background, I'm looking to buy my first real tracker. I have a $20 knockoff fitbit right now that I wanted to try out to convince myself I wanted one in the first place, and found out that I do. The thing is, I really don't exercise that much, so the intended purpose of these wearables aren't really what I'm after. I'm looking at these rather than smart watches for the battery life and small profile. My main criteria for a wearable are:automatic sleep trackingmultitude of smartphone notifications (call, text, email, calendar, 3rd party apps)music control5+ day battery lifebetter than splash-resistant water resistance (safe for showering and the occasional fall out of a canoe/raft)Very important - low profile!That last one is what has be leaning toward the OG VivoSmart. By my research, the Smart is about 7mm thick, and the HR comes in at closer to 12mm thick. The less obtrusive the better. Hence why I am here. If there are many reasons besides the HR monitor to choose the HR over the OG, then I may do that. Otherwise, I will probably stick with the OG.Should I be looking at any competitors? I checked out the Fitbit Alta too. It looks beautiful, but it is missing some of my criteria, namely the water resistance and the notifications.",garmin

Garmin Montana 650t issue,"I got a Garmin 650t as a present earlier this year and I've been having strange issues I thought you guys may be able to help with.

Using the basecamp software I was also able to make on-road navigation (used it on a 3000mi road trip both on and off road) but when it's used onroad it has some strange quirks. The moment I left the mapped routes 9/10 times it would immediately error out stating there was no path available. It seemed to have a large amount of roads that it came with but often got confused when trying to navigate them. Am I simply using this device incorrectly?

Vivosmart HR or Vivoactive HR? Advice for a dad of two trying to get motivated.,"After doing quite a bit of research, I have narrowed down my choices on fitness trackers to the Vivosmart HR or the new Vivoactive HR. (I had the Blaze for a week but returned it because it isn't waterproof). For the most part, I do cross training 4 times a week and cardio 2 times a week, usually indoors as a parent of two young kids. I also go for 30 minute walks everyday at work, and do some hiking on the weekends.Obviously, I want something waterproof, and that can track steps, sleeps, etc. I know the Vivoactive HR will be a better device, but feel it might be overkill for my current routine.  At the same time, the lack of ANT+ on the vivosmart is a downside, especially for cross training. I also think GPS would be neat for when I go on hikes with my kids.

Refurbished Garmin Forerunner 220 Calorie Burn Problem,"Hey, I'm posting for a friend so bear with me. She can pop on to answer questions if I don't have the answers.I got my friend a Garmin F15 for her last birthday, but the battery wasn't lasting long enough for the marathon we are running so I got her a refurbished from Amazon Forerunner 220 (listen, she's a really good friend!).She used the F15 for a year with the old style plastic heart rate strap so she has a good idea of her calorie burn and heart rate trends. She's using the 220 with the same strap she used for the F15, but suddenly her calorie burn is recording as far lower. On an 8 mile run it recorded as 487 calories, and on a 4 mile run it recorded as 280. This is roughly half of what she was burning before.Her heart rate is registering as the same as it did on the F15 (140-160 depending on speed), and she says she has put in her height and weight correctly. She is very small, 5'0"" and 109lbs, but even so those calorie counts seem absurdly low.I know there are two different engines for calorie counting but I didn't think the discrepancy would be this large.I haven't actually gotten a look or tried it myself so I can't say for certain, but she is tech savvy and I have no reason to doubt her reporting.

"Garmin Vivoactive HR impressions, and why I took it back","Last week, I posted a new thread here asking which would be better for me as a runner (with some other sports infrequently) - the Vivoactive HR or the Fenix 3 HR.  I've been wearing a Fitbit Charge HR for a long while now and I find the wrist-based, 24/7 heart rate measuring to be supremely helpful. I have wanted a more robust device though (with more metrics and data), and I wanted something that was both waterproof (it poured for about 1/3 of my last half-marathon and I worried about my Fitbit the entire time) and something that had native GPS and music controls.The overall consensus was that the Fenix 3 HR would be a better bet.  However, the Vivoactive HR I had on preorder shipped, so it kind of made my decision for me.I spent four days with the Vivoactive HR.  I wore it 24/7 (even in the shower).  I did one run with it each day - two eight mile runs and two 5k runs. Here are my thoughts:Pros:The GPS locked on fast and I had no issues whatsoever with bad GPS info.Everything is configurable. The watch face, what order you put your ""apps"" (read: activity types) in, the data fields in each activity (it defaulted to showing my current pace, but I was able to change it to show me overall average pace at a glance instead). Everything on it can pretty much be tweaked to how you like it.The variety of activity types was robust and more than I needed. I don't think I'll be stand up paddle boarding anytime soon.Battery life was great. I used GPS for running everyday and the battery meter barely moved.The move bar rules. That little red bar filling up when I've been reading or writing or playing video games is great and made me want to compulsively walk around or run in place to clear it.Cons:Build quality.  Almost all of my complaints are related to the somewhat shoddy build quality of the device.  It's not a super expensive item, but at $250 it's not an off brand, throwaway electronic either.  The materials all felt substandard (except for the watch band which was fine).The screen is abnormally dim. Even if you crank the back light setting to 5, it is insufficient.  Forget about using it at night.  Those bright pictures on the box? Nowhere near reality.The backlight seems to shine out of a small spot on the bottom left of the screen, almost like a behind the scenes flashlight. There is this one super bright spot and then ""normal"" (again dim) illumination of the rest of the screen. It bugged the crap out of me and made it feel cheap. Maybe it was a device defect for my unit.The touchscreen reacts slowly and sometimes misreads your finger taps. There was delay often when swiping up or down to get to different data screens. Also, it's not a huge screen, but my fingers would inevitably hit the wrong thing.  Once I deleted the ""Run"" app completely when I was trying to open up the data field settings. Also using it when sweaty or wet is hard or undoable.Glass smearing / quality - The glass on it smears easily and often, making it look ugly or dirty most of the time. I know, it's a touchscreen and it's going to get fingerprint oil and all that on it, but my phone is also touchscreen and has manages to look ""clean"" even when I put my slimy fingers all over it. The glass (Gorilla Glass? A cheaper substitute?) also looks plasticky and cheap, not like what I would expect for a $250 device.The screen resolution was poor. I don't expect it to be 4k but it still looked pixelated and grainy around the edges of things.I ordered a Fenix 3 HR and took my Vivoactive HR back to Best Buy for a refund when my new watch arrived.  I can say unequivocally that the people who responded to my last post were correct to say the Fenix. It has everything I put in the ""Pros"" above and none of the things I put in the ""cons"". It's just a really nice device that feels and performs rock solid. It was more expensive, but it feels like something that is worth the extra money, not like a shitty purse with a brand label slapped on it - the extra money goes for extra quality.",garmin

Vivosmart HR - can I connect the strap HR sensor?,"I'm using Garmin Vivosmart HR for a few weeks and I'm quite happy with it.

Vivoactive? Smart-tracking and size,"I'm considering the original Vivoactive as a running watch as it also looks less plastic-y than all the other sports watches and it's fairly thin.

This might severely influence my running distance, and the displayed pace. Anyone mind posting a photo of the watch on your wrist?

Can you use data from an Edge 520 to update fitness goals for the day on the Vivosmart HR?,"I've been dating a girl for a few months that has a Fitbit Charge HR that she loves. She is way more fit than me (my weight is fine, I just am really out of shape) so it's kind of got me trying to get in better shape. The problem is that I really dislike running and prefer to cycle. I like the idea of an all day fitness tracker because I'd like to make every day more active, even if I can't find time to cycle, but I know that wrist fitness trackers are essentially useless for cycling. I know that you can use a Vivosmart HR to track heart rate and send that to an Edge unit instead of using a heart rate strap, so you get all the info of both. However, I also know that the VSHR only sends info in one direction. Basically is it possible to use the info gathered on an Edge 520 to update say a steps goal or show miles traveled (some sort of conversion to walking/running equivalent) on the VSHR or is this even necessary? The girl I'm seeing can use walking or running to meet her 10,000 steps/4 miles goal but it seems like the ability to use cycling just isn't there. I hope my question makes sense, I'm likely over thinking this, but it feels like Garmin of all companies should have a solution for this.",garmin

Garmin calorie estimates from steps (Fenix 3 HR),Today I have walked most of the day sight seeing in Rome ( which is awesome by the way ). According to my Fenix 3 HR I have totaled 14647 steps today. Which Garmin estimates translates to 337 kcal. How is that even close?!I used to use a Fitbit flex and the kcal count for that amount of steps was way higher. My daily allowance of calorie intake is 1500. My BMR is around 1900. So I go by approx 400 kcal deficit. So today my allowance was raised to 1837. Isn't that a bit low given my amount of activity today?I'm a 188cm 84kg male. Anyone have any input on this?,garmin

HR Garmin Vivoplus review,"I received the HR garmin vivo plus  as a present and have been using it for 2 weeks.I would like to provide a review based on my experience.I have the activity tracker on all the time. The step counterwhen I wake up in the morning I have usually walked 1000+ steps. I am a restless sleeper ha ha ha.During a 1 hour hiit workout I managed to walk 4000+ steps. So overall the step counter seems too sensitive to be accurateI  have stairs at home (5 steps to get to each landing). Since the beginning the Vivosmart plus has indicated I have walked up 1 flight of stairs ever.I am not too sure how it determines what a constitutes a flight of stairs but the way I walk/run up the stairs does not seem to meet its criteriathe calorie counter  actually seems really accurate for me, kinda impressed by that.the pulse monitor also seems accurate however it disconnects when I work out hard.I have tried tightening and loosening the strap to see if that was the problem but to no avail.Everytime I got my pulse to 150+ it seemed to just stop tracking. I would get my pulse to 150 and then look at it  minutes later and it would read 80...umm no. I am ready to puke now.I took it swimming (I know its not a swimming tracker) but I was hoping it would track steps or something, sadly nope.The only way it will track steps is if I put it on my ankle and swim with it.I swim too slow to track steps.I wish I could turn off the lighting up of the screen when I flip my wrist.

Fenix3HR Elevation gain short by roughly 10-15% every activity,"Apologies if this has been addressed, but quick searched here and on Garmin forums haven't been much help.I have a Fenix3HR, my second one after the first was replaced by Garmin due to buggy satellite acquisition problems.  The 2nd one has worked fine until a few weeks ago.  Now the elevation gain is short by at least 10% on every activity.  This has been verified by several methods - known routes on century rides (published route had 2300' and the Fenix only registered 1712'), groups of people riding the same route (my results are always lower than everyone else riding), using Garmin's elevation correction feature on Connect, and last night by riding 22 miles using the Fenix and my old Edge 500 on the same ride.  Calibrated both and rode - the Fenix had 1299' gained, the Garmin correction put it at 1584', and the Edge shows 1712'.I've tried auto calibrate and calibrating at a known elevation immediately preceeding an activity.  I don't know if there is something else I can try at this point.  Garmin's support is generally less than helpful and I really don't want to do another replacement, but I will if nothing else works.

Fenix 3 HR - Randomly Changes Screen in Trail Run,"*Edit - I should have given feedback.  The problem was definitely the auto climb setting mentioned below.I have used my Fenix 3 HR Sapphire for a few weeks and love it.  This is the first heart rate monitor I have ever worn for running, so I am really trying to dial in my pace with the appropriate heart rate.  I like to keep the heart rate screen pulled up for several quick checks during my run.  Unfortunately, the watch randomly switches back to the first screen when in the trail run app.  The first screen contains the vertical ascent data, which is totally useless to me in real time.  I am nearly certain that I am not accidentally pressing scroll buttons because it always seems to switch to the same 1st data field (vertical ascent), which is about four screens above heart rate.  Also, I wear the watch all day every day and never accidentally press scroll buttons during my normal routine.  Also also, this doesn't happen in the normal run app.There is no pattern as to when this happens.  Sometimes it happens after less than 1 minute, sometimes I run 20 minutes without the random switch.  Each time, I scroll back down to the heart rate screen.I have firmware version 3.20 which I am told is the latest.I understand how to edit screens to customize what data is shown on each.  That's not what I'm trying to do.Does anyone know why the watch randomly switches off the heart rate screen to the useless front screen?  Having to scroll down four screens to get back to heart rate is annoying.TL;DR - Fenix 3 Sapphire switches off the HR screen randomly when using the trail run app.  Please help me make it stop.  No, I'm not pressing buttons.",garmin

Recently I removed the film off of the back of the watch and it left behind quite a bit of residue. Furthermore, I ready somewhere (don't quote me) that fitness tracking bands have a tendency to break after extended periods of use due to the amount of sweat and stress they're exposed to.I lightly washed the back of my watch with warm water and some dish detergent but that didn't remove too much of the residue.

Inaccurate Step Data on connect,"Is anyone else experiencing inaccurate step totals on connect? I know its really petty to get annoyed over this, but I worked hard to get my total step count for August over 500,000. I just totalled it up myself and I did get over 500,000 but connect has my total for August at 482,000...I had a bit of an iffy month this month due to injury so I wasn't expecting to get to 500,000. Then a week before the end of the month I realised if I did on average 20,000 steps a day I could reach my goal of 500,000. At a push I can get 20,000 a day so I walked extra every day just to get my totals. I knew for a fact that I had managed it so I was surprised when I looked that my total on connect was so low! So I added up all my daily totals and low and behold my total for August is indeed over 500,000.I know I probably just need to wait to see if it updates but I just wondered if anyone else had noticed their totals aren't right.

Vivosmart HR: any way to track step count during an activity?,"Title probably says it all.I'm using the VS to count my steps for the day and want to know where I am relative to my daily goal. I'd really like to also be using the activity tracking on the device & the Garmin website. When I'm recording an activity I get the new set of data screens which are great and I love that they're configurable and show two items of data at a time... except none of them, in any mode, appear to be able to show me my step count. Even the step count for the tracked activity would be good.So this means that, if I'm exercising with an eye on my daily steps, I typically don't use the activity mode... which feels like I'm losing half the capability of the device.So is there any way to combine the two? Get the extra detail of activity tracking AND see what my step count is? Seems a really odd thing to be omitting from those screens.Edit: revisiting this post to add an update: the VS is a lovely step tracker, like a Fitbit on steroids, but after a couple of months of use I found myself a little frustrated and wanting more - so I caved and bought a Vivoactive HR. Now I have my HR & geo data all in one place (yay!) and also the ability to see 3 different things on the screen at the same time and a choice of dozens of different data items (too many - this thing is astonishing!)... one of which is steps (activity steps rather than total day steps... but it's good enough).",garmin

"Intensity minutes - on app counts from Sunday, on watch counts from Wednesday?",I've had the vivoactive HR for almost 2 months now and it's fantastic (it's great to see how my heart rate goes through the roof when I'm downhill mountain biking! hahaha!) however - I have run into a little problem with the intensity minutes function over the past few weeks.For the first month the watch and app would both start counting the intensity minutes from Sunday (which is the day I have set as the start of the week) but the past few weeks the watch has started counting the first 3 days of the week and when it gets to wednesday resets its counting and finishes the week on saturday.The connect app and on my computer count the minutes for the entire 7 days from Sunday with no issues.I've tried searching for this on the garmin forums but haven't found a fix yet - anyone else had this issue?Cheers.,garmin

Vivoactive HR Activity Tracking Question,"So I just replaced my Fitbit Charge HR with this new fancy watch. I do a lot of running and I am very pleased with that feature.

Forerunner 735tx refuses connection to Ant+ Treadmill,"I just upgraded from a Garmin Forerunner 610 to the 735xt watch. While the 610 could connect to my gym's Ant+ enabled treadmills and stationary bikes, I haven't found a way to get the 735xt to connect to anything other than the HR strap that came with it. The treadmill is a Woodway 4Front. I tried about 5 of them and non showed any signs of connectivity. Once connected with my Garmin 610, actions on the treadmill such as starting or pausing would also start or pause the watch timer, and the treadmill's speed could be seen on the watch, which it used to calculate distance.I checked https://www.thisisant.com/directory/forerunner-735xt/ to see that two Woodway Desmo treadmills are supported. While only the Desmo line is listed, I know from experience that the 4Front line IS compatible with the 610, so I would have expected similar compatibility with any Ant+ enabled watch.Could it really be a lack of compatibility with the new 735xt? I called Garmin's front-line support and they pretty much declined to help me with the issue and was quick to push the blame to the treadmill.",garmin
New VivoActive HR user. Questions:,"Previous MSBand2 user, and with their recent decommission of the MSBand, I picked up a VAHR yesterday.I rowed for 45 min last night, approx 1000 strokes, used the indoor rowing app, and it registered a rate of 55-70 BPM the whole time, and spit out a caloric burn of 132 cal. My MSBand2 would have registered a HR range of 90-170 BPM, and about 900-1100cal burn, so I am definitely confused at this point.From what I am finding on the Garmin forums, apparently it has a hard time with it's optical HR, when indoor rowing, arm movement workouts, crossfit, etc. It has no problem with running or hiking, as the arms aren't flexed, or something.... (https://rowingmusings.wordpress.com/2016/08/23/vivivoacte-hr-review-of-the-gps-watch-for-rowing/)I used the MSBand2 to gauge my HR ranges, and the Garmin forums recommend using the chest strap for HR, and the VAHR for stroke count only, due to reported HR inconsistency.I relied on the MSBand2 for HIIT, as I could gauge when I was hitting my upper HR levels, and then at low levels for recoveries.I would be very interested to hear from someone who has used one of these for 3mo+, as I am SURE this is user error, at this point. Too many endurance athletes and triathlon users rely on Garmin, apparently, for it to be off by this much.Suggestions?p.s. - The phone and pc app itself, and the connectIQ dashboard are AMAZING, and it's a ton of useful info.

Workout Prompts on Garmins,"Hi r/GarminI'm hoping someone can provide insight on my inquiry since I don't own a Garmin myself, though I'm very interested in purchasing one in the near future. I've searched all through YouTube for how a workout is setup via Connect then synced to a Garmin. I can't, however, find much on how the Garmin actually prompts you if you have an interval workout synced to your watch.I'm interested primarily in setting up interval runs to train for a half marathon. So the standard warmup, interval runs with recovery, then a cool down. During the interval runs I want to set up 50% effort, then 80% effort runs, etc. So my question is when you have the workout activated, how does Garmin prompt you when the next interval is up? Is there a vibration on your wrist? A beep? I always listen to music on my iPhone when I run, so I'm hoping there's some sort of vibration feedback from the watch so I know automatically when to stop that interval vs recover.Also, would there be any possible way to differentiate between an easy effort run vs. harder effort? So would I be able to setup say one vibration for an easy run and two vibrations for a harder run?  Or a long vibration for a cool down, etc. I hope my questions are making sense.TIA for all the help!",garmin

How to remove virb edit garmin watermark,"So if anyone else here doesn't want their footage branded with Garmin after paying $399+ for the camera here is how you remove the annoying Garmin Virb watermark and still use the Gmetrix.All the watermarks are stored in a folder in Virb Edit. So the idea is to remove them or move them so the program cannot see them.Close VIRB Edit if you have it open.Navigate to where you installed it. Default location:C:\Program Files (x86)\Garmin\VIRB EditNavigate to:C:\Program Files (x86)\Garmin\VIRB Edit\Widgets\images\logosThis is where all the watermarks are stored.You can probably delete them no problem, but it's always good practice to save files instead of deleting them so if you don't want to delete the files create a new folder in that directory and name it something, I named mine HIDDEN.Place ALL the files except ""LOGO_CUSTOM"" into the hidden folder OR just delete them. You may need administrator rights to do so as you are modifying C:\That's it!If you want to create your own watermark you can modify one of the files in that folder with photoshop and draw your own watermark, the program will still use it but instead of GARMIN VIRB it will say whatever you put there.",garmin

Advantage of Older Garmin over Apple Watch?,"Hey guys,So I've really gotten serious about running now, and I just ran my first marathon (city of oaks, 3:25) and I've been training with my Apple Watch with strava and it's worked pretty well! I have noticed that the GPS over estimates distance though, on the marathon it ended up being a third of a mile off, which meant that I had to do math to figure out my pace and stuff. But all in all, it's been great. Having Siri on my wrist, being able to send and receive texts while running, and the fact it's for more than just running has made it invaluable to me. And I'm always going to run with my iPhone anyways, so that's never going to be a problem. However, I have considered getting an older garmin. I was looking at the 405cx because it's $50 used on amazon and it seems to have everything I could want.

Advantage with HRM-RUN over others?,"Hey /r/garmin!I posted on here a week ago about the advantage of a Garmin over an Apple Watch and I managed to get a Garmin 620 for free, so now I'm one of you! I still plan on running with my Apple Watch for music, so I won't need my huge 6+ bouncing in my run belt, but since the 620 does not have heart rate monitoring built in, and it will not cooperate with the Apple Watch's HRM, I have to buy one separately.So after watching a review of the 620, I found out about all the VO2 max benefits and about the cadence features of the 620, I was comparing my options with HRMs. After reading DC Rainmaker's review of the HRM-RUN, it appears that it is the only HRM that records cadence, but the watch will do that anyways. Additionally, it appears that the VO2 max estimates can work with any Garmin HRM.My question to you guys is: if I'm on a budget and all I really care about is the VO2 max info, should I just get the [basic Garmin HRM] (https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-010-10997-00-Heart-Rate-Monitor/dp/B000UOD5QM/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1479679578&sr=8-5&keywords=garmin+hrm), [the Premium model] (https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Premium-Heart-Monitor-Strap/dp/B00BI9X1QM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1479679650&sr=8-1&keywords=garmin+hrm), or the HRM-RUN?

HRM Run and the unavoidable rust...,"Hi Garnin owners. I'm a proud owner of one of the first FR620 available and while the watch never needed any repair, my HRM Run was replaced once because of bad HR readings.After maybe one and half years, it started showing incorrect HR as in under little or no stress and at a moderate pace the HR started increasing to levels which require a lot of stress. Example: a 7:00/mi pace on flat terrain and moderate temperatures usually I have a 150-155 bpm. This is OK. What started going wrong was under the same conditions of better like downhill the HR would go all the way to 185 or more...When this became recurring I sent the unit and strap (which was great) to Garmin and they game me a new one.I noticed that the contacts on the unit exhibited a lot of brownish rust.I made sure to dry the second unit after every training. And so this rust is now only appearing after another one and a half years. And the incorrect readings appear again. Now what I do is, I run for 5 minutes then stop the activity. Then wait a couple minutes and start again, then all is OK.I run an average 2000 mi/yr... and sweat will get there, that's what I think.Now its warranty is gone and I ask, any of you experience the same issue?Is this rust normal?Is there another treatment / care I should do to the HRM Run unit?Are there better HRM units that last longer before rusting?",garmin
"735xt, weird HR readings. Would you return?","I got a new fr 735xt about 12 days ago. It's a great watch, but I'm noticing a couple of little things that might not be right. 1) the battery seems to drain faster than I was expecting:I run outside for 45+ minutes every day, so I guess that might be part of the problem, but a charge seems to last about 5 days and not the 7+ I was expecting.And the HRM. It just seems off sometimes. Today it logged 189 as my high on a gentle, slow run. I've run enough in my life that I think my HR maxed out at 155 or so, maybe low 160s definitely not close to 190.

If I set clock manually it is fine, but on automatic its not. I have gps tracking on, but it does not update. I tried to switch to glonass, no change. I was recently in another timezone, did not change there either... Any ideas?",garmin

Two questions about Garmin Vivoactive (non-HR),"Hey guys -I have two questions about the Garmin Vivoactive 1st gen (non-HR).For some reason, the run activity just stopped vibrating and letting me know my mile split times.  I don't think I changed anything.  What do I have to do for it to vibrate and pop up the 2nd mile in 8:30 pace or something screen?  I now have to look down and do the math in my head.  I just don't know what changed or how to fix it or get it back.  Any help would be much appreciated.I'm a triathlete.  Again, I have the Garmin Vivoactive.  Has someone gone from the VA 1st gen... to the 735XT?  Do you feel that it was a worthy upgrade?  Or does the 735xt not have enough feature upgrades to make the switch in watches worth it?  I keep going back and forth about whether to buy the 735xt because I keep wondering whether the upgrade is worth it.  I have read dcrainmaker's site and done the product comparison calculator between the two watches.  I guess I'd just like personal experiences whether people were happy or didn't think the 735xt did much more for them than the VA1st gen.Thanks!  :)",garmin
Vivosmart going crazy,"I have a vivosmart (original) and the last few days every time I get a notification it goes crazy! Instead of just the one vibration it does a mixture of long and short vibrations, ranging from 3 to 7 times (possibly more, I haven't counted every time)! Which is just a little bit excessive... There doesn't seem to be a pattern to it, it just seems like it's freaking out. This is the first time it's ever done anything like this and its been well over a year since I got it.

Vivoactive HR heart rate problem,Hi everyone!When im out running and I measure my heart rate form the Vivoactive HR band   it stops around 65% of Max heart rate. It doesnt get any higher than that.

Its everytime right now so I stopped using the band for measuring and using my ANT+ chest band instead.,garmin

Thinking about a Vivosmart HR+,"I'm coming from a pebble, which was primarily used for notifications. I had all my main apps able to notify (facebook, twitter, slack, flowdock, skype, etc) but I could also turn off ones I didn't want. I'm looking for similar functionality as a starting point. I ride a motorcycle and bicycle, so having hands-free notifications from my phone is a must.That being said, I have a couple questions:Can you quick/easily disable all notifications/vibrating -- such as for sleeping or in a movie, without needing to open the phoneDoes it display ALL app notifications or only certain ones? Can  you choose which apps to allow notifications from?How difficult is it really to read a whole subject line of an email from a vertical display? It seems like this would be a major PITA for many messages and would still require me to open the phone",garmin

"Two weeks in, having problems with Vivosmart HR","I had a Fitbit Charge HR, and decided to move to Garmin because the fitbit was unreliable (broke multiple times).   In the two weeks I have had the Garmin, I have had the following issues:   -Zero intensity minutes recorded in two weeks. I just finished a 50 minute walk, which was properly recorded with elevated heart rate, and nothing. Ran on the treadmill for 20 minutes the other day, reaching 155 HR, and zero.-Floor count going crazy. Apparently I climbed 50 floors today in the office walking to the bathroom. There are no stairs.-Inaccurate sleep counted. I have my bed time set to 12:30am, but if I lie down to watch TV at 10pm, that is counted as sleep time regardless of walking around, taking out the trash etc at 11pm.

Garmin Vivoactive HR ?,"Hi everyone. I'm on my 3rd fitbit charge hr and Fitbit's quality is CRAP. They all suffer the same problem. They start to produce small bubbles in the wristband which gradually gets worse until the watch totally falls apart (charge hr strap is not replaceable). It takes 2-4 months before these symptoms start. You would think Fitbit would correct these issues but nope they just keep sending you the same defective product until your warranty period is up (though the CS is good they act like they never heard of this problem before....RIGHTTTTTT!!!). I've started to heard reports that the Charge 2 is starting to have the same symptoms (though the charge 2 straps are replaceable but not cheap). So anyways because of this i'm done with fitbit. I do love their software platform though and i was all in with even an aria scale :(. I was also happy with the HR monitoring, sleep tracking, step counting, ect.. I have my eyes on a Vivoactive HR. Before i pony up the money though i've heard some reports that the sleep tracking is very inaccurate. How true is this? This is one of my main use cases for the watch so its important to me. Was this an early issue that has been corrected with firmware upgrades or is it some type of big hardware issue that will never be corrected? I find the fitbits sleep tracking to be excellent. Also i find the HR tracking on the fitbit to be good for what i need it for. Hopefully the vivoactives optical hr is comparable.  I understanding there will be reduced accuracy with weight training (though with the vivoactive you can use a chest strap which should make it much more accurate).",garmin

Issue with Garmin drive 50 lMT - must hold down power button for minute or more to turn on?,"I've got a Drive 50LMT, and, once in a while, it will not turn on right away - I'll have to hold the power button down for a minute or two before it powers on.  The last time this happened, I hadn't used the unit for at least a week, so I'm thinking it might be related to battery life, but I don't remember the circumstances the other times it had this problem.  It's occurred in both heat and cold (well, not particularly cold - probably in the low-mid forties), so I don't think weather has an effect, either.I specifically bought another Garmin because I wanted advanced features that the TomTom only offered in conjunction with a mobile app, but this, combined with the fact that the new unit's maps do not contain many addresses that were on my old Nuvi (which I decided to replace after it shut off while driving through D.C. on a hot summer day - it was on my dashboard, but still!)  I love the Drive, but I'm worried that other issues may eventually pop up.(Note: I did submit the addresses I couldn't find to Garmin for them to incorporate into their map updates.)",garmin

Need some help deciding on a Watch,"Hi AllSo for a while now I have been looking at which smartwatch to buy, and I kept coming back to the Fenix3. For me, the running and sports things are not really something i am actively looking for in a watchm its more of a bonus, for me, I wanted a watch that had utility, and the built in GPS and Glonass was pretty cool. Also I liked the fact that you didnt have to connect a smartphone for it to function. And then one day I saw the epix. And it was even more of what i wanted. The built in maps were amazing, no other smartwatch did that, and it just added to the cool factor and utility. I recently ordered it, and literally before i even received the watch, I read that garmin will no longer be supporting the epix, rendering it effectively dead in the water. So I have to now return the watch (explain the massive price drop). My question to you all is, how useful is the GPS from a utility standpoint on the Fenix3. From a GPS standpoint, there is no map on the fenix3, so you can only use the GPS in relation to finding where you are vs where you were, not turning on your gps and knowing exactly where you are in general in the world. In a watch I am looking for survival features, useful things like long battery life, ability to locate yourself on a map (which only the epix had) Enough smartphone integration to give you notifications on any app that shows up on your phone. Useful sensors like thermometer, barometer altimeter (which fenix has). Really the only thing thats keeping me from buying the Fenix3 is the fact that the GPS doesnt seem very useful to me when you dont have any kind of map to place it to. I am hoping i got this wrong and fenix 3 does have some way of telling you were you are.",garmin

Gear Review : Garmin Index Smart Scale,"So, I finally caved and went all in with the Garmin eco system. I've had the Garmin Forerunner 230 watch for roughly a year now and it does what its supposed to- Very accurately tell me how my runs go. I was looking to get a scale and ultimately was told you should go in with whatever eco system you currently have - In my case Garmin (vs. Fitbit, Withings etc..) and oh my god, do I hate this device. The scale is significantly higher off of my body fat percentage than the Fitbit Aria which I used to own at one point. It also truly showcases how poor Garmin is at the software game specifically mobile. Setting up very basic things such as goal weight or trying to make sense of your data is mind numbingly difficult between the Garmin connect desktop app and your mobile app. Such a disappointing experience for what appeared to be a beautiful premium scale.

Sleep tracking Issues?,"Hi guys. I just got a Garmin Vivosmart HR. One of the reasons I wanted it was for use as a sleep tracker. I know I rarely hit REM sleep. I wake about three to five times each night at 1-1.5 hour intervals. I wanted to have some way of tracking this to see if I woke more.It appears the Vivosmart (and I may be wrong) tracks sleep based on HR and movement? However, I was wide awake for the first half of the National Championship game last night, but laid out on the couch with my dog. I got up once during the game to let him outside, once to get something to drink, once to take said drink back to kitchen, and once to plug my phone up. I ended up falling asleep a few minutes into half time. However, my sleep tracker this morning said I was asleep at the start of the game. It does show me ""waking"" on those times when I stood up and walked around, but only has me awake for a total of six minutes during that time.I know I can manually adjust what time I actually went to sleep, but I'm worried that the ""Deep sleep"" and ""light sleep"" times have inaccuracies as well, which is what I'm most concerned about.It shows me in light sleep for the times I was awake until half time, deep sleep when I fell asleep, light sleep again when I woke up and moved to the bedroom, and light sleep when my SO called at the end of the game, while I propped up in bed talking to him. Then, it has me sleeping until 7:51, with several times between 6:30 and 7:51 showing me ""waking up"". I was actually leaving my house at 7:51, and getting ready, feeding the dog, and having steps and stairs tracked while it shows ""light sleep"" in that time period.Is there anyway to get better information out of this for sleep, or am I looking for something more than this can give me?",garmin

Forerunner 230 syncing steps but not logging them day-to-day,"I use a Garmin forerunner 230 as a daily tracker and to track my activities. The watch displays a step count, as does my dashboard.

Forerunner 230 poor gPS tracking in Cold weather,"I've recently started having GPS issues with my FR230. Once per run, the track will suddenly jump around and add 1/4 to 1/2 mile to my distance. See here for two examples:https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activity/1518866785https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activity/1526429921This seems to only happen when it's below freezing, but it doesn't happen every time it's below freezing. It is especially likely if the temperature is in the teens (fahrenheit). I've also noticed that it tends to happen around 11 - 15 minutes into the run. My first thought was that my jacket was obstructing the GPS signal, but I've tried wearing the watch on top of my jacket, and that doesn't help.Other than the cold, it doesn't appear to be weather related. Sometimes it happens when it's clear and sunny, sometimes when it's cloudy and overcast. It doesn't seem to be terrain related either, as it happens on multiple routes, even those with few obstructions, and I've run the same route many times without it occurring. The two example runs above are the same general route, but the tracking problems occurred in two different locations. I've tried factory resetting the device, but that didn't help. It happens regardless of whether the watch is set to GPS only or GPS+GLONASS. This is my third Forerunner (previously had a 305 and a 220), and I've never had this problem before. As it is, I can't rely on the watch to tell me how far I have run because I never know if it's added extra distance due to poor tracking, so I'm basically stuck using it as a very expensive stopwatch.Have any of you encountered this issue? Any ideas what's happening and how to fix it? I've reached out to Garmin support, but I thought I'd see if Reddit had any advice while I wait.",garmin

Vivoactive HR for Strength Training/Powerlifting,"Hey all, wondering if any of you recommend this watch as purely tracking strength training workouts. I don't run, occasionally cycle as cardio but 99% of my training is with weights, focusing on Squats, Bench Press and Deadlifts. Just unsure if this watch is overkill for that or not, or if I should look at the Vivosmart HR+, or even the HR, or look at more of the Fitbit Charge 2?I should mention that, maintaining or obtaining a certain heart rate is not a goal. I mainly just want to see where I get up to, what I average, and see if I take adequate rest etc. Mostly for casual fun, not anything serious. I do enjoy the sleep tracking and notifications and stuff too.",garmin
Fenix 2 Rebooting when starting activity,"Today my Fenix 2 started rebooting as soon as I started any activity (run, workout). After a while, it started rebooting itself. After reseting, hard factory reset, and all, I've contacted support. This was the response:""We can offer an exchange. The cost of an exchange is $110, and Garmin will issue you a Return Material Authorization number (RMA). We will wait for your unit to arrive and then process the exchange which will take about 10 - 14 business days. You will receive a newly overhauled Fenix 2 as an exchange which will come with a 90 day warranty.""Given it is pretty new (I've bought a year ago but just started using it now), I don't want to pay half its price to get an 'overhauled' unit.Googling it, I've found that doing a hard reset (turn off, turn on holding down button) and after that removing all content from the 'mass storage' fixed the unit and it is not rebooting anymore.So, Garmin would charge $110 for this? Clearly this is not a hardware problem, but a software one.Pretty frustrated with this Garmin product.",garmin

Aside from that it looks like the 230 has more running stats and the ability to add apps. I'm currently leaning towards the 230 but I thought I'd get opinions on the two.

Fenix 3 HR optical heart rate off in recent workouts,"My workouts over the several weeks have been showing lower than usual heart rates.

Lately, my averages have been between 135 and 145 for a similar level of exertion and will max out at 155. I thought little of it, assuming it was just something to do with my physiological state at the time, but today during a 6 mile run, my average heart rate was 122 with a max of 150 when I was going about as hard as I could for ~half a mile.When I got in the shower, heart rate started dropping down to the 60s not even 5 minutes after my run where it's usually 100-115. I took the watch off of my right wrist and put it on my left and it returned to about where I expected it to be. As I type this, I'm at 70 no matter which wrist it's on. Also worth noting, I read that hair can interfere with optical heart rate monitors so I shaved a patch of my wrist hair off on my right wrist. Any ideas?

looking to purchase a gps device for my car.

From what i read in the website it seems the HD traffic updates more frequently than the Garmin Traffic. Am i understanding this correctly? AndIf HD traffic isnt available in an area im driving, can the Nuvicam resort back to Garmin Traffic as a default or would there be no traffic updates available at all?I see there is also a Live Traffic service available. is this a free option to add on to a nuvi or driveassist?Since the Live Traffic service uses your smartphone data, is this going to be more accurate and faster than what service HD Digital traffic offers?would data usage using Live Traffic service be as much as if i were to just use my smartphone using google maps?is the difference between the hd digital traffic and garmin traffic services minimal enough where i should just save the $100 and get the DriveAssist instead of the Nuvicam?thanks.",garmin

Vivoactive HR - active calories WAY off,"I'm hoping someone here can shed some light on the problem I'm having with my new VAHR. I just upgraded from a Fitbit Charge HR that disintegrated for the third time in 18 months as I have been looking to improve my running and figured a real GPS-enabled device would be great for training this summer. I really like the interface, I haven't had many problems with syncing or setup, and it is a huge upgrade from a Charge HR in terms of features. But... the active calorie burn is WAY off.I'm a 5'8"" woman, 31, about 144lbs. My daily TDEE is around 1780. On a normal day walking around the office but not doing anything else, that's around what I burn (plus or minus 100 calories either way). I track my food on MFP and have successfully lost quite a lot of weight and am now maintaining, so I have good reason to rely on these numbers. I've been using a Fitbit for activity tracking and never gained or lost while maintaining based on the numbers it gave me.With my VAHR, it's like down is suddenly up. Yesterday, other than a 50-minute workout (avg HR around 148), I basically sat on my butt all day. I even took a nap! Normally, that workout would be good for maybe 450 calories for me, which is great - a TDEE of maybe 2,200 = extra snacks But the VAHR calculated my 'active' calories at more than 1600, giving me a total TDEE for the day of 3,175. Like I said, I'm a medium-tall, not overly large woman. The funny thing is that it calculated the exercise calories basically at the right level - so I started wondering if it was double-counting the HR/activity-tracker calories somehow.Today the same thing happened, except I didn't even work out. I walked to and from the subway/bus, probably about 20 minutes or 30 minutes of walking total all day. In between transit, I was sitting at an event. The entire day, basically sedentary. Yet my VAHR seems convinced that I've burned 1200 active calories on top of my BMR. That's 2,500 calories for the day! That's a level I MIGHT get to on a pre-winter-sabbatical long run day or when I walk basically all day. I Facebook-messaged Garmin about this and I'm waiting for a reply, but I'm wondering if anyone else has had this problem and fixed it? I really like this device, but I really, really value the activity-tracking side of it, and not using an activity tracker for that purpose seems crazy to me. Other than this, it seems to be working great, but I can't find anything that might actually solve this problem. Help? Please?",garmin

Vivoactive HR Calorie Calculations,"I'm wondering if anyone else has seen what I'm seeing with calorie calculations.  I bike and run and I've been comparing the calories for different days and they are way off from each other.

What other factor that I haven't listed (that isn't a constant such as age and weight) could I be missing in their calculation?  I've only had this thing for 2 weeks but I've seen the same   inconsistencies in calculating calories for running as well.  Everything else (distance, time, speed, etc) seems to be pretty consistent.  Is there something I can do to normalize the results so that, if nothing else, I can at least get some consistency in them?Thanks for any input.EDIT: Also been having problems with the pins in the band staying in place on both sides of the band, usually during a run when its most likely to fall off.

Bluetooth and Smartphone Link,"Got a bit of a problem with my Navigator V on my BMW motorbike, which is based on the 660 GPS.

Training Effect,"Last week I ran about 11 km and my trusty FR 235 calculated a training effect of 3.6.  A few days later I was going through the settings and noticed that the heart rate zones, which were calculated automatically, were way off. My max heart rate was 10 beats higher than anything I normally experience.  So I updated the max heart rate and the zones were recalculated.Yesterday I ran the same route in a few minutes less time and my Training Effect was 5.  The fact that the Training Effect is so dependent on heart rate zones, which I can change however I wish, is a little frustrating, but the main concern I have is I don't know WHY my training effect is what it is.  In fact, I was a lot more exhausted after my run yesterday than the run last week, so I do believe that I was working harder for some reason (it was warmer, for instance).  But it'd be nice to know that the long hill after 8KM was the one that racked up all the TE points, for example (which is my instinct: that hill kicked my ass).  If I wanted to do a run with a TE in the 4's so I'm not over-exerting myself it's not clear what to do. Run slower? Run less distance?  Right now, Training Effect seems like some voodoo metric no better or worse than other proprietary metrics like Strava Suffer Score or Smashrun's Performance Index.  It seems like Garmin could at least provide a intermediate Training Index after every 15 minutes or whatever is required to calculate the number so you can see what's going on.",garmin

Garmin Forerunner 235 HR sensor stopped working,Hi everyone.. my Garmin Forerunner 235 HR sensor stopped working last week.

optical HR-sensor: How snug Does it Need to be?,"""Snug"" seems to be the favourite word for describing the recommended fit of your watch for optical HR purposes. But here is the dilemma, as worded by my manual: ""The device should be snug but comfortable.""For me, outside of actual active training where I do not care, snug equals not-so-comfortable. Especially if 'snug' means what our Rainmaking-guru tells us:>Before we move on to the test results, note that optical HR sensor accuracy is rather varied from individual to individual.  Aspects such as skin color, hair density, and position can impact accuracy.  Position and how the band is worn are the most important pieces.  A unit with an optical HR sensor should be snug.  It doesnt need to leave marks, but you shouldnt be able to slide a finger under the band (at least during workouts).  You can wear it a tiny bit looser the rest of the day.He also says that typically, measuring HR is easy when we do not move around that much:>In most cases, the vast majority of the devices on the market today actually nail the first part without issue.  Measuring your HR optically when not in sport/exercise isnt terribly difficult.  Numerous models out there today that suck at sport/exercise are perfectly fine (even great) in non-sport conditions.  Its usually the excessive movement that causes the challenges.So I wonder what your experiences are. My current strategy is, as endorsed by our DC Rainmaker above, to leave it looser for regular work, and then tighten it when running. What are your strategies and/or experiences?",garmin

My reasons for choosing the 5s over the 5/5x.,"I had a really hard time deciding between which Fenix 5 model to choose, and since it seems as if I am not the only one, let me share my thoughts. Let me first say that I think they are all fine-looking watches, so my assessment below should be read in relative terms.Here it goes: My planned use case for the fenix 5 was a watch to use all day (and night), and for that I wanted it to be comfortable enough and decent-looking enough. While male, I have rather small wrists (approximately 16 mm circumference, c.f. pic below for 5s fit on wrist), so I figured the 5x would probably be too large, but I ordered all three of them home to compare. After deciding that the 5x was indeed a non-option compared to the others, I took turns wearing the 5 and the 5s. I really wanted to prefer the 5 due to the larger screen size and extended battery life, perfect for my hiking and eye-sight. But it was not long until it became clear to me that the 5s, for me, simply was preferable.In short, it came down to size and looks. For a wrist as small as mine, I thought it simply looked better. 42 mm is still a rather decent size for a watch, and this would be my 24/7, so then I wanted to be able to wear it to work as well as when running or hiking. In addition, while I really liked the look also of the 5 in the abstract, when it was on my wrist I thought it was too much in-my-face, its visible screws sticking out in a way I did not like, aesthetically speaking. The 5s looked more neutral in a, for my use case, good way.Hence, in my book the 5s was the distinct winner in the looks-while-on-the-wirst department as well as the comfortable fit/weight department. My remaining doubt were about the screen size/readability and battery life. There, the other models had the definitive upper hand. In the end, I judged both readability and battery life to be good-enough. 24 versus 14 GPS hours is of course a significant difference, as is 60 vs 35 hours in Ultra Trac mode. While I can confirm that the readability, in my experience, is just fine, I guess I will have to bring that extra battery when my hikes are longer than a weekend. That is a comparable bummer, of course, but for me, that was a trade-off that I could live with.Six days into my 5s, I can only confirm that I am super-happy.EDIT: The fenix 5s on my wrist",garmin

C'mon Garmin!,"I am new to the route/course (I will use 'routes' in what follows) planning in Garmin devices, and I am trying to get a hold on how best to approach it for my Fenix 5. From googling (and the answers to a previous post of mine) it seems as if the native Garmin Connect Course creator or the routeCourse app are my two best options. But both of them seem strangely limited, and so I want to ask here to see if I got it right. Is it true that:You cannot import pre-made routes into Garmin Connect, only import activities and then make them into routes, and then delete the activity so that Garmin does not log it before I have actually done it? (It seems so basic that I figure I must have that wrong, but I can't seem to find a way)You cannot get a route suggestion from two points on the map in either of the two desktop apps? (routeCourse does even use google maps, but still I can't find an option for letting google do the hard work.)I do not understand how such basic functions are not implemented, Garmin being market-leader and all. The best solution I could come up with was this:Follow this excellent guide for turning a google map route into a gpx fileImporting the file to routeCourse, which then magically lets itself be synced to the watch when I start routeCourse on it.While this process works beautifully, it is cumbersome. And it makes me a little sad that such a lovely wonder of a watch does not have better app support than what Garmin Connect provides. While I understand that Garmin makes money on the hardware, not the software, they must realise that for the user, these two aspects are interconnected.",garmin

Are Seconds in the Watchface Impacting Battery?,Did anyone tested if using seconds in a watchface has any impact on battery usage? I have a Fenix 5s and its not easy to notice the difference due to the fact that most of the battery goes with GPS activities so its not really easy to notice,garmin

Is there a watchface compatible with the Forerunner 235 that display seconds?,"I recently downloaded the GearMin watch face.  I really like seeing all of this great data in one spot, and not having to toggle to a different face to see HR, steps etc.However, the bummer is it doesn't display seconds!  There's some settings for this, but it seems they only show up on the face intermittently.   It's kind of a dealbreaker for me.   Scrolling through my options in the ConnectIQ store, I can't seem to find a watch face that will display seconds, it looks like installing any custom watch face means you get rid of the second counter?  It looks like the original watch face is the only way to consistently show seconds in the day.Is that right, or can someone here recommend watch face that will still display seconds?",garmin

vvosmart HR+ to fenix 5 -- large discrepancy in caloric expenditure,"A couple of weeks ago I went from a Vivosmart HR+ to a Fenix 5. I've noticed that the calories reported for workouts are consistently lower (quite considerably) on the Fenix 5 than for very similar workouts done with the Vivosmart.&nbsp;Here's one example:https://postimg.org/image/ovkpfzrof/ - Fenix 5https://postimg.org/image/89356wyqn/ - Vivosmart HR+&nbsp;Another is my cycle route to work, which is 24km and always basically the same. The Fenix 5 reported 414 calories with an average HR of 136, while on a lower effort day (1.5 kph slower average speed) the Vivosmart reported 531 with an average HR of 123. And one more, a fast 5km run I do regularly: Fenix 5 216 calories with HR 157, Vivosmart 316 calories / HR 165.&nbsp;Now slight differences in the optical HR sensor between devices are to be expected and I would never expect 100% accuracy, but  surely caloric expenditure should just be some function of HR/time/BMR and that should be the same between devices. So why does the Vivosmart report 30-45% greater caloric expenditure for basically the same workouts, and which is more accurate?&nbsp;Edit: line breaks",garmin
235 HR data looks weird after runs,"I've had my Forerunner 235 for almost a year and a half now and I've loved every run with it, but for the last month and a half or so the HR monitor during runs has been way off. I know since it's wrist-based it's not going to be the most accurate, but usually it'll be off for a minute or two before getting back on track so the average winds up being roughly what it should be. Lately, though, about half my HR graphs from runs have just been either lines with a constant slope up or a constant slope for a while and then the exact same for the rest of the run (want to note that those sudden dips don't line up with rest stops, either; they're just random downward spikes). Is this some sort of software bug? I don't know what the sensor would be picking up that would cause the graph to look like that since it's definitely not locking onto my stride. My normal graph (i.e., just wearing it around during the day) looks fine, it only seems to be acting up on runs.",garmin

What garmin watch to buy,"Hey,I'm a 20 year old girl.I run a lot, so the primary use of my watch would be for running, long and short distance.

How does VO2max calculation Work?,"I recently purchased a FR235. I am wondering how the VO2max calculation is done, and how it is triggered. Currently, it shows a pretty low value of 36. From my max and resting heart rates, and my race times it should be in the 40s. Garmin Connect shows the same value since the day I received it, even though I didn't do any activity on that day. Since then it is constant, even though I did a few activities (mostly trail runs, which are not very fast). The web page shows the value for every Monday, while the Android app shows points apparently for each activity (5 activities total). If it's using activity data, I would expect some variation, but it seems to be stuck. Even more confusing, on the watch itself it looks like I can change the value to whatever I want.So my question is: how can I trigger a VO2 max calculation, and how do I get the most accurate results?",garmin
Is the hR on the 235 good enough to warrant picking it over the 230?,"Its time for me to get a new watch and I'm really into competitive running, I run 60 ish mpw and love running statistics (I'm on strava, etc.) Used to have a FR220 before I lost it and now use a FR10. The higher models are too expensive for me, I'm looking for something $250 or under. The only difference between the 230 and 235 is the heart rate monitor, and I'm not  even sure how much I'll use it. Is it worth it? amazon has the 230 for $169 right now and that's hard to beat if you compar eit to the FR35 which is the exact same price on there right now. The 235 is still $329. Also--the 920XT is $220 on Amazon, what are thoughts on that?",garmin

GARMIN INDEX SCALE &lt;MAC ADDRESS&gt;,"So, simple answer I used my cellphone as a mobile hotspot to connect my garmin index smart scale to it.

Dumb question about HRM-Run,"I decided that $350 for the Forerunner 735 + HRM-Run was a good deal so I got one and it arrived today.  Previous to this I had a Wahoo Tickr.  My dumb question is: since the battery is bolted into the HRM-Run, I'm assuming that it goes into standby whenever it's not being actively used by the watch?  When I start a run, the strap will wake up and then go back to sleep when the watch stops talking to it?With the Wahoo Tickr I the pod connected to each end of the strap.

Buying advice,"Hello Guys,I am looking at buying my first gps watch. Until now I was using my smartphone to track my runs, listen to music and so on.I am planning on using a garmin watch to track run & heart rate (using a chest strap) and Mighty to play spotify so no interest in music capabilities. Optical heart rate I find it nice to have your 24/7 heart rate monitored but I will not use it when doing sport. I am not planning to swim a lot and am not interested in swimming metrics (just interested in monitoring heart rate during this maybe). Same for cycling.Given those information, what would be your recommendation ? 235 seems the way to go. I also looked at the 735 which has strava live segments but I think I can get by the function by syncing the data after the run and check how I actually did against others after the run. Turn by turn navigation is not a feature I attach importance to. Only thing I could buy the 735 for is its (apparently) more responsive behaviour and is ability to be more future proof regarding garmin connect apps.What are your thoughts on this ? Thanks !",garmin

I bought it with a focus of running in mind but I also wanted something feature packed that looked nice. 5 months later, I have all these issues running with it which makes me run with both the watch and my phone for better accuracy. I feel like I forgot what the main reason was why I bought the watch. This is why I have decided to go with a manufacturer known for running.Here are the issues I have to which I would like to know if buying a Garmin will fix:Accuracy. Some times the watch will not connect to GPS and there is no GPS icon to indicate if and when this happens. My entire run is ruined.The screen goes to sleep, which only shows my watch face. Therefore when running I need to raise my wrist and wait 1-2 seconds for the actual run data to come on... or I need to press a button.The actual UI of the watch during a run. With the samsung, it  only shows 2 points of data. Time and Heart Rate. For everything else, I need to rotate the bezel. With a 42mm screen you would think they can show time/dis/pace/HR. Or at least 3 out of 4.So I guess my question is, does the forerunner 235/630, Fenix 3/5 or any other model fix these issues?

Again, my effort level did not drastically change.Could the baby oil on the skin be affecting the reading of my heartrate, or could it be something else?(Note: The optical sensor and strap give equal readings when in training. However I've been having trouble reaching high heart rates for high intensity.

735XT heart rate dropping out randomly,"I got a 735xt a few weeks ago and have been loving it, wearing it almost every day.

I wasn't very satisfied when I looked at my watch and seen that the steps counter is increasing rapidly even though I was sitting on my bum. Roads are quite bumpy around here so I understand that it could be misleading for the sensor but does it have to be? During 50 minutes long ride it counted around 600 'steps',  I find it really annoying because is quite a huge number (in my eyes). I do have Polar M400 which I did replace with my Fenix but I don't think they are that much 'sensitive' but the truth is I never checked that in numbers I just watched the activity bar and never found it counting anything when I was travelling. What's your opinion and/or experience?",garmin

[experiment] Fenix 5 Optical hR vs fenix 3 with HR strap (Squash),"Hey r/Garmin,I just upgraded to the Fenix 5 Sapphire (Japan edition) after owning a Fenix 3 Sapphire (US edition) for more than a year and a half.I know my F3 was more than enough for my fitness tracking (mostly weightlifting/trail running/hiking/road running/cycling/squash) needs, but I just couldn't stop fantasizing about the F5 with the better battery life, smaller size, crispier screen, better GUI, and most of all, the optical HR sensor.I love my HR data, so I knew that I would still be using the HR strap on my F5 for my activities, but I wanted to test out the accuracy of the optical HR vs the HR strap with different activities.And I'm sad to say, I'm pretty disappointed.I know that the optical HR sensor has its limits and is not accurate for most activities especially things like weightlifting, but I thought it would be at least somewhat useful for sports like squash.SetupI tracked the same squash activity with my F3 connected to my HR strap, and F5 with the optical sensor. Importantly, I had my F5 on my left wrist, wrapped tightly, and I am right handed, so I wasn't doing any racquet swinging with my arm with the F5.ResultsImage linkMetric comparisonCategoryFenix 3 w/strapFenix 5 w/ opticalAverage HR14879Max HR181137Calories burned518171Aerobic TE2.50.5Fenix 3 activity linkFenix 5 activity linkConclusionI know the issue gets solved if I just use the strap for my F5, and I will, but as a test to judge reliability of the optical HR sensor at least with an activity like squash (and I'm assuming also for similar racquet sports like racquetball, badminton, tennis, etc), it's pretty disappointing :(And yes, this is only n=1 and this could be an outlier, but I really wanted to like the optical HR sensor. Unfortunately for me, this means I will be wearing my HR strap for all my squash sessions.I will be testing it out my F5 again tomorrow, but on a city bike.This time, I will be able to compare not only the HR, but also the GPS track.(One of my biggest complaints of the F3 was the shoddy GPS track)Questions for you:How reliable do you think the optical HR is on the F5?For which activities have you seen the best results with the optical HR?For which activities have you seen the worst results with the optical HR?Thoughts on the optical HR?TL;DR - Tested the F5 optical HR sensor vs the chest strap on my old F3 while playing squash for 60 minutes. F5 optical sensor gave disappointing results.Edit: Added the links for each activity",garmin

Garmin fenix 5x and activity class,"Over the past couple days I have been playing with my Fenix 5x and the activity class settings on Garmin connect. I have a few questions for the community.

Please help! My Garmin vivoactive HR is recording inaccurate swim distances. What can I do to fix it? (x-posted to swimming),"Hi guys, I've been having some trouble tracking swim distances with my Vivoactive HR. Garmin support hasn't been super helpful so I was hoping you guys might have some tips for getting more accurate results.I'm a beginner swimmer, I just started a few months ago. Very shortly after starting I replaced my FiBit Charge HR with a Garmin Vivoactive HR to track my swims, but unfortunately it's been pretty useless. I've been swimming with it a total of 12 times and every time the distance has been innacurate, sometimes even showing double the distance. Here are a few examples: Recorded distance: 2900m Actual Distance: 1500mRecorded Distance: 1550m Actual Distance: 1000mRecorded Distance: 1800m Actual Distance 1200mAfter seven inaccurate recordings like this Garmin support told me to replace the watch with a new one. I've been swimming with the new watch 5 times and it still isn't tracking distances correctly. It's been slightly better. A week ago it got within 300 meters of my actual distance but it's also been as far off as 800 meters. I haven't bothered contacting support again as they were totally baffled by the issue the first time so don't think they'll be able to do anything. The chances of getting two faulty devices in a row are pretty slim, especially since it records my running distances and heart rate perfectly. Almost all the reviews and forum posts I've read about this watch say the swim tracking is accurate so there has to be something I'm doing wrong.The Garmin website says that distance can be innacurate for inexperienced swimmers, so that must be why it isn't working for me. I'm a pretty crappy swimmer, the furthest I've ever swam freestyle without stopping for a rest is 800m which took me 24 minutes and 17 seconds. And the fastest I can swim 50m is 1 minute and 9 seconds. I've been swimming once or twice a week for a few months. ( I also play ice hockey and run so I don't have a ton of time to practice, just took up swimming to mix up my exercise routine a bit.).What can I change about my technique to make the Garmin more accurate?I've already tried all of Garmin's suggestions Eg: setting correct pool length (50 meters), not stopping or changing stroke mid length, using intervals for rests, gliding after pushing off from for wall etc... Don't really know what else to try.What do you guys suggest?",garmin

Training Plans,"I got a 935 for Father's day. I'm disappointed with the training plans. First, they are very limited, not very many training plans. Second, swimming only shows up as a note on the calendar. Third, only runs are showing up on the 935. I kind of expected that the swims weren't going to show up (because they are notes on the calendar) but the scheduled bike time isn't showing up either.  Fourth, I'm not receiving any type of notification when I'm not in the correct zone (during a scheduled run). Fifth, when I complete a training run, it's not indicated as such on the training calendar. It shows the scheduled run and a completed run but treats them as separate entities. Sixth, there is no flexibility. I can't choose to do tomorrow's run from the device. I don't think I can even shuffle my training schedule online and expect it to sync with my device after my next run. I don't think I can even view my training schedule from the 935.Admittedly, I'm new to this device so perhaps I'm doing it all wrong. I'm really hoping that's the case and those who have been using Garmin training plans can straighten me out. So please tell me, how do you use your Garmin to train?",garmin

Garmin 230 Pace Indication is Way Off,"So, this is my first post on the Garmin subreddit, and it comes out of a good bit of frustration with my Forerunner 230.I purchased my Garmin Forerunner 230 last July to replace my ancient Forerunner 405, and for a long time I was very happy with it. To be fair, for the first month or so of ownership, the displayed mile pace would become very inaccurate when I would run underneath heavy tree cover, but that issue somehow soon cleared itself up. I had no further problems with that and could run in even heavy woods without issue.As time went on, I continued to use the new watch nearly every day, taking it to college with me and running in various places across the East Coast of the U.S., all while enjoying the device's enhanced capabilities.Over the past two months or so, however, I've encountered an issue that has become extremely irritating to a data-focused runner like myself. No matter what I do, on nearly every single run the mile pace indicated on the watch face will be slower than what I know I'm actually running. Now, it's no enormous difference; for example, the watch will say I'm running a 7:10 pace when I know for a fact that I'm pushing more like a 6:30, which I've backed up by wearing my old 405 at the same time. It's not the end of the world, but it's very annoying to someone like me who is a fiend for running data.I called Garmin Support about the issue, and they said it might have been an issue with me not syncing the watch or updating its software regularly enough. In response, I began syncing and updating the watch via Garmin Connect several times per day. Although this vastly improved my GPS acquisition time, it did very little to help the pace issue. The watch still indicates way too slow of a pace, especially in the first half of my usual 10-ish mile runs. In fact, updating the watch has even caused it to once again become confused by even a small amount of tree cover, even just a couple trees lining the side of an open road. Weirdly, when we went to Switzerland for a week in May, I ran several times, and everything was as correct and working well as could be. It was awesome! Unfortunately, however, the issues returned as soon as I arrived back in the U.S.Any help or advice in fixing this issue would be more than appreciated! As a complete data nerd and pace-focused runner, I'm tired of fighting with my watch on every single run. Thanks, and happy running!",garmin

Garmin Vivoactive HR - Massive overestimation of calories,"Hi ThereLast week I purchased a Garmin Vivoactive HR, and have been using it every day since aside from one day I forgot I'd purchased it.Almost every day it massively overestimated the calories I've burned. Today for example I went to the gym for an hour. 30 minutes of running, 25 minutes of moderate cycling and 15 mintue assorted casual strength training. I'm a teacher anyway so with it being the summer it's not like I'm spending the day on my feet constantly walking or running about.Somehow from today, my Vivoactive managed to figure out I have burned 1500 calories and walked 9 mile. I reckon I would feel it if I walked 9 miles at any point todau.It seems to calculate my steps fairly accurately, and my heartbeat accurate enough, but it pulls these ridiculous calorie burned figures out of its arse, and it's extremely frustrating to see such inflated figured every day.Is there a calibration I need to carry out on this watch, that I perhaps missed out when I binned the instructions along with everything else I foolishly thought I probably wouldn't need?Thanks for reading",garmin

"Garmin Device - Steps, Sleep &amp; Heart Rate not in Sync - Solution","Hi guys! Just wanted to share with you what I recently found out. When I got my Garmin Vivosmart HR+, I sync'ed it to my wife's account first to test it (as I was testing another device at that time) - after which I then sync'ed it to my account &  used it for the night and found out that the sleep tracking wasn't working. The steps & all day heart rate weren't moving to my Garmin Connect as well. I can totally see those data in my watch/band. Using it for Run or Walk sync'ed the data through fine. It was frustrating!I've tried a bunch of things: re-installed, reset the device, etc. and yet to no avail. Finally I realized that when I sync it to my wife's Garmin account - I didn't ""retire"" or ""remove"" it from hers. So I ""removed"" it from her account and since then my device has been sync'ed properly. Tonight I'll try sleep tracking and hopefully no issues this time!Just to share - you never know if someone out there had faced this before & got stuck. I noticed someone in Reddit posted something like this 10 months ago via Vivoactive HR - but it's archived.. so thought I start a new one and let you guys know the solution!Update: Sleep tracking worked like a charm!",garmin

Fenix 5 v 5x,"Hello everyone!I've decided that I'm going to invest in a Fenix 5. I'm a collegiate outdoor professional but I would be using the multi sport functions, sleep tracking, and bio metric data more often than mapping. It would be an every day watch in the office, gym, and outside. I've never used digital mapping for any of my trips and I'm not an ultra light guy. If I'm not already using mapping, is there much of a reason to make the jump to the 5x? Is there a reason outside of mapping to get the 5x? Is the mapping that life changing? I'm concerned about the extra bulk as an every day watch as well as tracking sleep with the discomfort.On another note, are there any outdoor people (specifically climbers) that have had an issue with not getting the sapphire edition? I know it's commonly thought of as not needed but that usually comes from the multi-sport community and I'm not as familiar with the outdoor perspective.

Fenix 5x and cals. This is long.,"I used to run quite a bit when I had the fenix 3. I always discarded Garmins calorie expenditure and relied on my fitness pal mainly for calorie suggestions. A year ago I was in a bad car accident. I have 6 bulging discs, 3 in my thoracic and 3 in my lumbar. I have 3 schmorle gnodes. Chronic pain, etc. I fear my running days are behind me, but I'm able to be more active again. Defiantly not doing p90x or insanity again, but active. I started Walking and I'll start swimming soon. Stay positive. This year I've gained about 15 to 20 lbs of fat I'd guess, also lost quite a bit of muscle so the scale only says I've gained about 10 lbs. I received a fenix 5x and getting motivated again. I wrote all that to ask if anyone trusts Garmins calorie calculation for daily cals burned or not. I'm hesitant. I'm shocked how many calories it is saying I'm burning.I weigh 160lbs. Sense I've been exercising again I got my resting heart rate down to the 50s, and I don't usually go above 165. I've walked 14k steps today, and part of that was on a treadmill set at 12 incline with speeds about 3.2 mph. I burned almost 500 cals doing that for 45 minutes. Resting cals says 1635. I can accept resting cals because it's not crazy. I can accept work out cals being 500. But then on daily activity it is giving me over 700 active cals. I've been up sense 4am, walked to a corner store. Got to an air port and dealt with that hassle. Got home and cleaned like a mad man. I'm rambling. Either Garmin is in the ball park and I've been starving my body with 1600 to 1800 cals a day (burning over 3k a day) or Garmin is throwing cals at me.I just feel lost and frustrated and if anyone can steer me in the right direction I thank you.",garmin

GPS - any fixes? (Fenix 5),"I really wanted to like this watch, and I did... until I started using GPS. It has so many erratic jumps it doubled a recent walk of mine from what was 5miles to 10 miles, completely ruining most of the metrics it captured. Coming from an Apple Watch where I've used it for a couple years with similar routes, I never experienced this issue, so I'm surprised that this device, being specifically marketed for GPS, is practically unusable for that purpose, and the only thing I've found in response to this problem is an apologist video saying it's the best it can be for a consumer device, posted by a user who clearly hasn't used a Watch before for comparison.Anyways again I actually love the Fenix in general.

Is the footpod still the best way to go when running on a treadmill hands down or does the Treadmill Calibration replace the need for the foot pod when using the Garmin Fenix 5 line? Just looking towards winter and running indoors, debating buying the footpod if it is at all any more accurate.to quote Garmin:> Added support for Treadmill Calibration. When saving a Treadmill running activity for the first time, you will be given the option to enter the distance that the treadmill recorded. This will improve the accuracy of the distance that the watch records during future treadmill activities. You can also choose to calibrate when saving any treadmill activity. When you are done with your activity, stop the timer, scroll down to 'Calibrate & Save.' Then, enter the distance that the treadmill recorded. For accuracy, these options become available when recording an activity longer than 1 mile or 1.5 kilometers.",garmin

Question about Calorie Burn symbol on Vivoactive 3,"I just picked up  the Vivoactive 3 and love the look of the device and it seems to work great when tracking, but the app and watch seem to have a little bit of a learning curve and are a bit clunky compared to other fitness watches I have used.I changed the watch face to show the calories burn symbol and it says 2721 and I was trying to see where that number is coming from in the app. Is that number of actually calories burned or is it some estimate that it expects to be burned by the end of the day?Also when I check snapshot it says 1207 Active Calories, but when I click that it says Resting Calories 1,149 + Active Calories 34 for a total of 1,183.I have re-syncing and restarting both devices, but I don't understand why the numbers don't seem to match.EDIT::ImagesEDIT:: Adding to the top.I just figured it out, it was My Fitness Pal.MFP changes the look of calorie tile from calories burned to calories remaining. Once I removed MFP it changed it back to showing calories burned.I am not 100% sure about the active calories yet, but I did make adjustments to the calories burned in MFP and maybe that is reporting back in some way that screws that up.",garmin
Fenix 5 elevation drift after update?,"I'm new to this subreddit, but I'm giving it a go since I'm starting to get frustrated.  I've had the my Fenix 5 since june. Upgraded from a Fenix 3 non-HR.When I first got it, I experienced quite a lot of elevation drift while not moving (upwards of 50-100m in a few hours) - an issue I didn't have with my F3.However, it got updated quickly and seemed to fix the issue, and only drifted a few meters during an entire day at work.Now, since 5.40, it's back to drifting - and just today, it drifted 40m during the night, while laying on my bedside table.A few times it's even bumped my elevation from 200 to 900 m within minutes.  I can't seem to find anyone else with a similar issue - so I'm asking here, as I'm getting tired of having to check and calibrate the altimeter several times a day to stay within reasonable elevations.

Think of G-metrix as the third track: Video, Audio, and G-metrix. G-Metrix data has to be imported with the clip or added manually later. If you copy & paste the clip into the editor that will give you the audio & video but not g-metrix. For g-metrix you have to Import clips into Virb Edit. Or once you have the clip you can import it manually by finding the correct g-metrix file on your camera. If you deleted that file there is no way to get it back.Virb Edit software stabilization is not available/grayed out, why?  Not all video modes may support video stabilization. Additionally you may need G-metrix data imported to have stabilization available as u/curiosity_opfer points out below.I cannot import new clips, the camera is connected and ON but the ""Import New"" button is grayed out and unclickable, what do I do?The only reason I found for this is there is not enough space on the disk where the files will be imported to import them. You can check this by clicking &quot;Import Selection&quot; then selecting all the clips you wanted to select. At some point the import button will be grayed out and you should get a hover bubble over it saying &quot;There is not enough space in the Clip Library folder to import the selected clips&quot;. To solve this you need to make space on the your hard drive where you store your clips.Media Foundation vs. Ffmpeg vs. DXVA?Encoder (only affects export / sharing):Media Foundation: Fast, lower quality. Cannot create videos bigger than 4GB on Windows 7, and cannot create videos larger than 1920x1080 or frame rates greater than 120fps. These constraints are caused by Microsoft, so they cannot be fixed by us.Ffmpeg: Slow (extremely slow at higher quality settings), high quality. No file size or resolution constraints. Produces smaller files than Media Foundation.Decoder (affects export/sharing and playback):Media Foundation: (Fast over all performance, but low quality and can't read videos that are too big) Uses graphics hardware, but with lower quality (causes some color quality loss causing videos to look gray). Does not work with videos larger than 1080p. Uses lots of memoryFfmpeg: (Very fast on PCs with decent CPUs) Higher quality with no resolution constraints. Uses less memory. CPU power is the limiting factor on speed. Fastest performance for PCs with newer CPUs, very very slow for machines with older or slower CPUs.DXVA: (Really really fast on laptops / notebooks) Uses graphics hardware with comparable quality to ffmpeg. Extremely fast on laptops and other devices with integrated graphics hardware. Slower on machines with dedicated graphics cards. No constraints on resolution.SummaryOver all, if you have a laptop, DXVA is likely your best option. For PC users, if you want high quality and dont mind waiting, use Ffmpeg for everything. If you want your video faster, use Media Foundation for everything. Using the Media Foundation decoder and Ffmpeg encoder is a good compromise between quality and speed.",garmin

VA3 VO2max Question,"Purchased a VA3 last week and am very impressed so far. It replaces a Forerunner 235 that I sold almost a year ago after an injury. I wasn't a huge fan of the 235, mainly because the hr sensor was uncomfortable -- I could never get used to the bulge. However, I really liked all of the data it provided, especially the heart rate zone and VO2max readings. If I remember correctly, the VO2max readings on the 235 recalculated with each workout. While I know that the VA3 also estimates VO2max, I've yet to figure out if it, like the 235, will recalculate VO2max automatically, after each workout. The manual is no help in this regard (and is actually no help in any regard, imo). Is automatic VO2max estimation possible on the VA3 or must owners move through the built-in VO2max test? Thanks!",garmin

Vivoactive HR heart rate WAAAAAY off,"I've had my Vivoactive HR since Feb 2017, replacing a dead MS Band 2. I didn't pay too much attention to heart rate until later in the year when I tried using it with my Garmin Edge unit for cycling. Prior to the Vivoactive, I used a Garmin chest strap to send heart rate to the cycle computer. I figured it would be convenient to broadcast heart rate from the wrist, but when I tried it and actually began to look at the heart rates it was measuring, it seemed way off.Like, when I was in situations where I knew my heart rate was well over 100, the Vivoactive was reading nonsense like 65 or 70 bpm. It didn't seem so much like it was reading low, but more like it just wasn't reading correctly at all.I wear the garmin on my right wrist, with sensor on outside of the wrist, as they recommend. I've tried keeping the strap very tight, to no avail.Also, just got a Peloton indoor cycle, and have paired it with my chest strap. As I ride, I can also check the vivoactive, and I get the same thing -- the heart rate being measured by it seems to have no relation to what the chest strap is picking up.So, was just wondering if this is a typical issue with these devices. Do others get good HR readings from them? Should I contact Garmin for a replacement? Any other thoughts or advice?",garmin

notification implementation same on Fenix and Vivoactive 3?,"Hi, is the handling and display of notifications the same on the Fenix 5 range and Vivoactive 3? Tia",garmin
bought the new apple watch but returned it and went back to my fenix 3,"Thought some people may find this helpful.&nbsp;I got to admit, I got swayed by Apple's sleek animations and the premise of a ""computer on your wrist"". It wasn't however until I started using it on a daily basis that I started noticing which features I actually need and like (getting notifications) and which are superfluous gimmicks (most of the apps). This made me realise that the core 'smartwatch' functionality I use is identical to what I was used to on my Fenix 3 - getting notifications. There are some minor technical differences in implementation of course - the Apple Watch has a much nicer screen, however, it's not always on and requires me to wiggle my wrist to wake it or touch it. The apps are turned our to be very rudimentary and after playing with them few times, I never bothered to use them again - do we really need a bank app in a watch? or a messaging app that needs to be updated every time you open it? I'm not convinced. There was one thing however that I was still really looking forward to, that I had really high hopes for:   Health and fitness. That turned out to be a disaster.&nbsp;  Heart Rate:Poor sampling rate. I know that all new Garmins - F5, 935, Vivo 3, have a 24/7 1s sample rate. I expected the same from Apple Watch. Nope. HR is measured every 5-10 min. Disappointing.Reliability - HR measurements when not on the wrist, initial HR readings immediately after putting the watch on being highly incorrect and take minute or two to stabilise - the problem is, those incorrect measurements are saved as well meaning youre getting bad data.&nbsp;Workouts:Whats the point of ""rowing"" programme if it doesn't even record stroke rate or distance? or even let you edit it later?Treadmill workouts being off by 20-30% with no ability to amend itZero workout screen data customisationTapping the screen to stop the workout with sweaty fingers doesn't work. No min HR, max HR, no zones, no recovery dataLack of any kind of progress/achievement system - best times, best laps, best 5K, etcNo advanced metrics of any kind - stride, cadence, zones, running dynamics.Garmin has been leveraging FirstBeat tech for years now providing tons of additional information, insights, and comparisons with thousands of other users. Apple Watch provides less data than the basic Forerunner 35.Incredibly delicate product - got it scratched and dented on the 2nd day. My F3 has been through Scottish hell and looks brand new.I also didn't realise that there's no option to see the health data on the computer or through the website.&nbsp;Pardon my rant. I'm just really disappointed. After reading articles about Apple's huge fitness studies, poaching top specialists from Nike, and ""the biggest update to watch ever"", i was really expecting little it more.&nbsp;I thought I'm gonna miss the ability to play music during workouts without the phone, however I've already solved it by buying an old, tiny iPod Shuffle.&nbsp;  I think I'm just gonna buy Fenix 5 now...&nbsp;  &nbsp;UPDATE:I BOUGHT THE FENIX 5X!",garmin

"Vivoactive 3, a huge dissapointment","I got my VA3 on thursday last week, and i have to vent about how dissapointed i am, and hopefully get answers to some questions i have that can help clearing up why it underperforms as much as it does.Since thursday last week i have been using both my VAHR and VA3 on each their arm. I have used them exactly the same way, so there should be no settings affecting results.The battery life of VA3 is supposed to be 1 day worse in smartwatch mode, and equal in GPS mode. What i have experienced is that the VA3 only last about half the time of the VAHR when doing the exact same actions the last few days. I read a post about restarting the watch after updating to 2.50, and i did, but its still a lot worse than VAHR.The GPS on the VA3 is alot more inaccurate than the one in VAHR. I have used it for 8 sessions, and all of them show a significant higher count of errors in terms of misplacement, cutting corners etc on the VA3. The only example i can show to is a run on a curcuit, since the reader can here see where i were actually running.https://imgur.com/a/4hjndI don't know if they will implement manual rounds to the VA3, but its a dealbreaker for me if they do not. I would go so far as to say i'd prefer the option of manual rounds over the option of preloaded sessions (which was one of the main reasons for my upgrade).I understand the manual circuit may be added in a future firmware, but is there any hope for a fix for the GPS? And the battery life, so that it at least is equal to the difference in battery life they market between the VA3 an VAHR (1 day difference in smartwatch mode / equal in GPS mode)?The only positive thing i can highlight about the VA3 is the design, and that the HR sensor feels more comfortable, and SLIGHTLY more accurate compared to my chest strapIS it possible that my unit is faulty?Thanks in advance for any answers that can help illuminating some of my reasons for dissapointment :)I have 27 days left of my return policy on the watch, and will keep on comparing the two units. but i cant say i'm optimistic about keeping the VA3.TLDRThe VA3 is a huge dissapointment to me, as it is a straight downgrade in a lot of critical factors compared to its predecessor; VAHR.",garmin

Fenix 5s six month anniversary: a love story.,"tldr: Six months in, I still love my 5S.&nbsp;The full monty:After some decision anxiety about which model to pick, I bought a Fenix 5s this April. I posted some reasoning around my decision (here) as well as my pimping efforts (here) in the sub. Since it has now gone six months, I thought it proper to report back and tell you that I am still in love!Unsurprisingly, I am no longer constantly checking Garmin Connect for my stats, etc, but the fact remains that it is immensely valuable in actual practice, sitting on my wrist for the full day, seven days a week. That says something in my book, since I am not normally a fan of weight on my wrist. (Consequently, my other watches the last decades or so have been resting on my desk at work and taken off in the hallway when I get home. But not this one.)My main activities are running, walking and trekking, and now, having had it for the full summer, with all the running-walking-trekking that has entailed, I can only say that it is a true gem. The sports/health-related activities are so quick and easy to use that actually using them becomes second nature after a while (not like it was back in the ol iPhone-as-running-gadget days).That part was not too surprising though. The big surprise for me has been how great the everyday-utility of the watch is. While I would not have bought it were it not for the sports applications, the reason I keep  it on all the time is the basic utility that is brings. Being able to immediately notice text messages and incoming phone calls has been surprisingly useful (especially since I often keep my phone on silent). Indeed, in general the fact that it is always on my wrist has made me use things that are harder to access than on my phone, like the timer and alarm clock.All of this would not have been enough, I must however admit, if I did not like the look on my wrist. If the watch had  gone for the traditional gps watch look, i.e. Star Trek communicator, I would never had gone for a watch in this price range. Now, it entered classic sports watch land (at least potentially), and with that I felt that I could motivate the price tag. With the women model 5S, the Fenix series now could emulate the classic size of a mens sports watch as well, 42 mm. To my aesthetic sensibility (given my small wrist), that was vital.It looked good right off the bat, but to my joy the potential to un-gps its look was very high. A watchband change and some watch face try-outs later, it gained the look that has remained ever since.In sum, while each individual aspect of activity trekking, daily utility and looks would not have been enough to make me keep it on my wrist at all times, in total it has collaborated into a watch that I am still fully in love with and that I constantly keep on my wrist. Let us hope that our love affair has a bright future still!",garmin

Fenix 3 HR versus Vivoactive 3,"Hi all,I'm looking to upgrade my Android Wear watch as I'm looking for something more robust for fitness tracking.  I've been patiently waiting for the VA3 slate to appear for ordering ($329) and have found a refurb Fenix 3 HR for $342, so about the same price.  I've actually patiently been waiting for over a year for a decent fitness watch, but the VA3 is the first thing I've found that tends to fit my needs as none of Android Wear, Apple, or Fitbit have gotten their fitness chops together regarding HR and in-depth data.I've spent A LOT of time here on Reddit, in the Garmin forums, reading DC Rainmaker reviews, etc., and I'm leaning toward the VA3, but I'm not sure if the Fenix gives anything the VA3 does not.My general week includes 4 days of strength training, 3 days of a fairly intense tabata style boot camp class, and 3 days of running (800 repeats, 5 miles hills, 10 miles mostly flat).  I don't consider myself to be a ""runner,"" certainly not to the extent I'd order a Forerunner, and my understanding is the Fenix and VA3 are better for all around activities.  Feel free to correct me if I have that wrong.I'm interested in the Garmins because I always want to have the HR and GPS there and available.  Currently, I have to take my phone for assisted GPS on runs and use a BT chest strap for HR.  I understand the optical HR is not the greatest for intervals, but I usually don't wear the strap for these, and I think the Garmins would be great for some of the steady state runs and give me at least something for the other activities.  I'm a data nut and am also interested in the all day HR tracking, fitness age, recovery, etc. that my current watch/Google Fit does not have.I don't care about music.  I don't listen to it when running and haven't loaded a single song onto my watch in the 18 months I've owned it.  I have an app on my phone for lifting.  I do use my watch to record sets and timers, but it isn't a dealbreaker if Garmin's rep tracking is not perfect.  Regarding Garmin Pay, I have NFC on my phone and have used Android Pay twice anecdotally.  I simply don't go anywhere to buy anything without my phone and wallet.  Maybe that will change someday, but the lack of NFC in the Fenix is not a concern for me.I had an all button input Pebble and a touchscreen Android Wear.  Both types of inputs have their advantages.  I suppose I prefer touchscreen, but it's not a wide margin of preference.I'm leaning toward the VA3 because it can connect to peripherals with ANT+ and bluetooth, and I would still use the strap sometimes for precise HR data.  My understanding is the Fenix only has ANT+.  Also, the VA3 has the fast-swap bands.  I do change my bands frequently between a silicone for workouts and leather or metal for a nicer look at the office or going out.So, what I'm really wondering is if the Fenix offers anything over and above the VA3 that I seem to be missing out on.  I just can't find much the Fenix does more than the VA3.Appreciate any thoughts as I make a final decision.",garmin

Vivoactive 3 Vs. Forerunner 735XT,"Hi guys,So I've been debating between the 735XT and the VA3 for a while now and I'm still unsure on which to choose, so I was hoping you guys could help me make up my mind.I've done some research and these are the thoughts I've gathered:The 735XT seems to be able to do everything the VA3 does that I need it to do (e.g. running, cycling, etc), and is currently 20 cheaper for me compared to the VA3. 735XT also appears to have better passive battery life (11 days vs 7 days) and about the same in GPS. I'm also training for a triathlon but I don't really think the convenience of not having to stop for example my run to start my cycling leg when I'm training is that much of a deal breaker. In a race I don't think I'd be too bothered about that either since it realistically takes seconds. Garmin pay is a nice idea but I take my card/phone everywhere anyway so not really too concerned with that either.On paper I'm looking at the 735XT but I'm getting this uneasy feeling buying a watch that's 1 year old when I could be buying a brand new one, so I guess what I'd like to know is whether or not the VA3 outclasses the 735XT in any other ways (besides looks) and if the 735XT would still be a good purchase even though it's a year old now.Side note: I've seen various varying comments about the oHRM on the 735XT some saying that it records 24/7 but only every few minutes compared to the VA3's 24/7 at every second. Could anyone confirm this?Thanks",garmin

All I need it to do is log my coords while moving, and then display my current speed and distance since last whatever (button press ? turning on ? unpausing ? ).  When I plug it into the computer I'd like it to download the data and then show me more advanced info like elevation gains and drops, altitutdes at certain points, etc. Will GPS mode do all that ?  if I turn it off when I'm not actively moving (sleeping, eating etc) and I'm only actively using it for 12 hours a day will one set of batteries last me a 3 or 4 days ? edit: I wouldn't be moving quickly, and it looks like ultratec mode would be fine for me (60 second polling intervals).  I'm sure that would make the battery last a lot longer.  I wonder if I'm using ultratec mode are there watches that could handle a couple days of 12 hours at a time ?

Intensity minutes vivosmart hr+,Since the last update I am having huge issues with the tracking of the intensity minutes.

fitbit vs. gramin? (looking for a smartwatch upgrade),"Background Info:I have had a Fitbit charge HR for almost two years. I called in my warranty 9 months after purchase bc the band was pulling away from the screen. Got a new one for free. 12months later, the same thing is happing. There is no warranty on the replacement. -_-So I am in the market for a new smartwatch and I'm completely torn between the Fitbit Ionic and the Garmin Vivoactive3.I like that the Fitbit app holds all my fitness data in one place, more or less. However, it's not 100%. I have 2 years worth of data already on the Fitbit platform. I was using the calorie counting feature until it told me to only eat 500 Cals a day to lose 2lbs a week. Switched to using Loseit!. (Loseit! still syncs back to Fitbit but not vice versa)I have never the Fitbit exercise app to track my running correctly so I just use Runtastic Pro. Basically, I have been outgrowing my Fitbit's features but have not been able to find an all-encompassing replacement.The Ionic and the Vivoative3 have almost the same features and they are the same price. (I am also open to other suggestions)WishlistTrack HRSee notifications (would like to be able to reply/answer calls though not 100% req)Pause exercise - ex. when I'm stopped at the crosswalk during a run but don't want that the standing time counted towards total time.Track StepsBe a watchHave 3+ days chargeTrack SleepWaterproof ( I hate worrying about my watch when I run in the rain)I'm a runner - working towards a marathon - but I also do a lot of walking, moderate cross train, occasionally hike and rarely bike.I have been leaning towards the Ionic for days but the reviews keep me wavering.

Fenix 5 (and similar) auto calibration Procedures?,"I wonder if anyone knows what automatic procedures, if any, garmin devices such as the Fenix 5 use for calibrating the measurements shown on the watch. For example, I find that the altimeter on my Fenix is often telling me that I am below sea level when I obviously am not, and when I am demonstratively very close to the sea it seldom gets that right. Since I often use the gps for running and walking, there should in theory be many, many opportunities for the watch to compare the gps data (which admittedly is not perfect either). But does the watch use the available gps data at all to calibrate?Even more important than the altimeter is the step length, and so I wonder the same here. Now I know that the gps is not 100% here either, but it is still rather accurate (on my latest half-marathon, my watch recorded 21.65 km, and although it made me somewhat mad at the time, it is merely 2.6% off). So if the watch were to calibrate the step length from the gps data, I guess it would be fairly accurate even when you are not using the gps.",garmin

VA3 Swimming issues,"I have been, for the most part, enjoying my Vivoactive 3. While it's not perfect, I do like the functionality of it. Since getting the watch I have used it swimming around 20 times and I have done a few different tests on the watch. I have 2 issues about the swimming exercise on the watch. These are the issues:#1 Battery Life#2 the Touch screenBattery life is probably the biggest issue while swimming, but only for a few reasons. For example, if you go for a 90 minute swim you will lose approximately 30% battery life. That happens if you leave your backlight on. I currently run my backlight gesture ""off"" except for activities. However, after seeing the battery usage with the backlight on during activities with swimming, I now turn the backlight completely off before I swim, and now the battery usage went from 30% down to 5% for the same 90 minute time period. It's a pain to have to turn off the backlight every single time before I swim.Now why does this happen? That's the second issue, the touchscreen. Any time water hits the touchscreen while swimming and having the backlight on during activities, the backlight will turn on. The other issue with the touchscreen while swimming is when your hands are wet and the watch is wet, the touchscreen does not work.My suggestion for a solution for this is for the watch to automatically turn off the touch screen while doing the swimming exercise. The only time you need to use the touch screen is right before you start, while you set up the pool length. You save the activity by holding down the button. So if you turn off the touchscreen during the activity, it will help preserve battery life.",garmin

Help me pick a Garmin Gps Watch,"Little bit of backstory, i've always been a bit heavy (6'2 208). I am looking to lose this weight and I have an interest in running, however I am a huge nerd and I love seeing my numbers and stats like my time, distance, time per said distance, I had my mind settled on a forerunner 235 but it's way too expensive for a high school student like me, the only think I need is an all day step goal (5000/10000 50%, on a giant wheel like on most of the forerunners), GPS+Glonass, all day distance, when i'm running I want distance, time, time per distance and the ability to upload to apps like strava, having connect iq (I think that's what it's called) to be able to get custom watch faces and stuff like that is always a huge plus. I don't need a HR monitor or the VO2 max or even the time prediction for the next race based on the last race or any fancy stuff like, I just need some basic statistics. I had a fitbit flex 2 and I really liked the achievements page on it because I get motivated by data and stuff like that, AI adjusted goals are super nice and motivating, i'm competitive so I like to beat these goals and numbers, but none of this is included in the run of the mill ones. I lift weights and go to the gym often but I don't care about that being tracked, I only care about the stuff I mentioned above, I run and bike occasionally. Sorry if this post is all over the place, i'm super tired and burnt out from my sickness. I don't have a super tight budget but please don't recommend anything I would have to take a loan out for, im gonna say a $300 budget and that's the very max. Reddit do your thing.

"FR935, training load metrics and weightlifting","Hello, new Garmin user here!Recently bought the FR935, I train swimming (2-3x/week), running (2x/week) and olympic weightlifting (2-3x/week). I'm especially interested in the new training load and stress metrics that come with the FR 935.I wear the watch normally day/night-round and also during my swims and runs, but cannot wear it during oly lifting training sessions. Hence I'm wondering how accurate these metrics might be in my case? If I simply enter my workout (reps and sets) on the phone app post-workout and put the watch back on then, will the training load metrics simply pick up this info together with my HR and still be able to predict an accurate recovery time?Or does it work differently?

Vivomove HR - run tracking accuracy,"Hey guys!I'm looking to buy my first fitness tracker and I'd love any thoughts/reviews of the vivomove HR if any of you have had hands-on experience with it.The activity/sleep/HR tracking sounds nice and all but I also wanna be able to track my occasional runs and sync with strava. It's a shame there's no built-in GPS but definitely understandable. What I'd like to know is, how accurate/reliable is the accelerometer-based tracking? Has anyone compared it with GPS data? I wouldn't mind carrying my phone with me during a run but I hear that you can't tether GPS data from the phone. Is that true?Any other comments on it would be greatly appreciated.

"Multiple trackers, one user","I currently have a VivoFit 3 and Ive just ordered a VivoMove HR.

Will the Garmin ecosystem know what device is correct and only use that data, or will it be constantly mixing and merging data from both devices and basically all be a useless jumble?

"love my VA3, not having reported problems","I bought myself a new VA3 from Amazon for holiday gift, received Dec 21.Many people have reported some problems they have with VA3:Binding with AndroidShort Battery LifeReps or activities not recordedGlitchy app or firmwareI think, from reading online like here:https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2017/10/garmin-vivoactive-3-in-depth-review.htmland my own experience, Garmin have recently made big improvements to software.Binding to my htc1 m8 (android 6.0 marshmallow) was smooth and without issues.  The app syncs (and resyncs, like after a run) to the VA3 quickly and seamlessly on Android.  As for Apple, I am a sane person, and therefore no longer use Apple products, so cannot comment. (Flame on, Hipsters! I gotcha covered ha ha. )Battery life is longer than 3 days, that is the longest I go without charging, and it still has juice.  (This is without gps, see below.)  Also, full recharge requires only about 30 minutes.Reps and activities do have some minor issues, but mostly work OK.  You have to set up your activities using the watch or the app, and touch start to begin counting.  (That's not on the face, it's the button.  That did cause me some confusion until I figured it out.)  Reps, like for lifting, seem to work fine usually, if you have set the correct activity.  Also, you can edit reps after each go, but I think you need to use the app for that, I'm not sure, which means you would need to keep your phone handy, inconvenient.As for glitchy, the app works smoothly and syncs quickly, but there are some quirks.  The ""floors"" counter sometimes shows 6 up but only 2 down, or some such, so it is not reading correctly.  Also, during intimate activities with my girlfriend the ""steps"" counter increments really fast.  Having the ""GOAL ACHIEVED!"" screen appear, with a trophy icon and vibrating indicator, when this goal has not actually been achieved, can be distracting.  The Heart Rate indicator, however, seems to work very well.The only major issue I have had is with GPS.  I have not been able to get GPS to work at all.  The on line reviews say the battery charge goes down fast while using gps, but I can't comment on that, because I can't get GPS to work at all.  So, to reiterate,  GPS does not work on my watch. At all. Ever.I can say the compass widget works fine without GPS.This watch looks great.  I got the black with slate hardware.  Another cool feature, well thought out, is that the band is standard 20mm watch band.  The stock black rubber watch band is great for exercise and workouts, but not really appropriate for more formal activities.  Guess what - No Problem!  It has a 20mm standard watch band so I will be down to the jewelers for a seiko or citizen band to wear for all the rock star and charity events I am constantly being pestered to attend.To conclude, Garmin have listened to their customers and fixed most of the problems with their previously crappy software, and the hardware works pretty well too!  The heart rate monitor in particular is excellent. Overall, except for GPS, I am very pleased with this watch.  Most of the bad reviews are from before they fixed their software, so kudos to Garmin for listening to their customers.",garmin

Any way to sync/send data from Garmin Connect to Google Fit?,"I got the Vivoactive 3 for Christmas as a replacement for my Pebble (which I loved), and so far I'm liking it, but not being able to sync my step and other fitness data to Google Fit is a real bummer.I've seen this topic covered a few other places on here, the forums, and a few articles, but so far none of those options have worked. I've tried the following:Strava - it looks like it syncs workout data but not step count. I don't know if it actually works as I haven't gone for a run with the watch yet.Fitness Syncer - it looks like it has the ability to take Garmin Connect data and send it to Google Fit, but in practice doesn't work. I've tried multiple times and messed with some settings but none of the data from Garmin Connect gets sent to Google Fit.Endomodo - same with Strava, it doesn't appear to support Step Count.MyFitnessPal - started using this when I got the Va3 and it's great for sending calorie intake to both Google and Garmin, but it doesn't support step or other fitness data.I liked using Google Fit as a central hub for my fitness data as I've previously used a Pebble which was wonderfully open. This was one of the (many) problems I had with FitBit too. I've given up on Garmin ever natively supporting Google Fit, but I'm open to other solutions.Has anyone found a working service that connects to both apps?

Vivoactive 3 Newb Active Calorie Question,"Just got my VA3 for Xmas and am excited for it to help me on my way to getting fit.  I only had the opportunity to wear it at work (desk job) for a couple of days, but the active calorie count seems crazy.  I haven't done anything in the last few days but take a few walks to meet my step goals and to take a few laps up and down the stairs.  I'm 5'10"" 198, mid 30's. Resting HR 64, high 142.  943 861 (see edit below) calories seems insane for 6700+ steps and 13 floors.  I understand some BMR is at play, but am I the only one who thinks this is way too high?  Plus, isn't the BMR already counted in the ""rested"" category?  I saw some other, older posts with similar complaints on other devices, but the firmware was updated a couple days ago (v2.8).  My height, weight, etc is programmed into both the app and on the web version of Garmin connect and my activity class is 0.  Do I just need to wear it more to get it calibrated, wear it in my sleep, or have they just still not fixed this?  Is it useless as a step counter or sedentary calorie tracker?  I'd like to know what I am already burning off so I know what progress to expect when counting my intake and subtracting my real exercise.  If that is hopeless, is there another tracker option better at this?  Thanks.  My apologies if I am beating up a dead horse, just want to know if I am off the mark or if I need to look at other devices while there is still time to return it.

HR monitor help,Backstory:I've been running with the vivoactive (1st) for the past year. I've been monitoring my hr with the $25 hard plastic Garmin monitor and it's been fun.

Walking under activity stats in the connect app,"I have a forerunner 735xt. I bought it primarily for run training, and I'm also using it to track my sleep a few nights a week. When we're no longer frozen solid, I'll also use it to log hikes, but that's not as important to me.I also take walks in my lunch break at work. I notice that in the app, activity stats lists walking. However, walking is not an available activity profile on the watch. If I want to log my walks to view in app, what activity profile would work? Hike? I tried creating a custom walking activity profile, but it just goes into the app under activity stats --> all activities. There's nothing under activity stats walking. I haven't tried the hike profile yet. Should have today but didn't think of it.",garmin
Weird glitch - notifications sent to my watch went nuts after sending a Glympse location from a Paired phone,"Last night, I sent a friend my location through Glympse via text on my LG G6 paired with my new forerunner 735xt. A few moments later, it started forwarding notifications to my watch, constantly, about once a second. It kept the watch screen lit, ate 5% of my battery life in the 10 minutes I had to wait to find a place to pull over, and all I could see were the Glympse notifications. This is something I sent, not something I received. I couldn't even get into the watch menu because more notifications popped up constantly. I couldn't turn Bluetooth off on my phone because I was also using GPS through my car, so I had to pull over, unpair the watch from the phone, and then reboot the watch to get rid of the, by that point, hundreds of notifications. I paired the watch again after the Glympse time frame expired, and it was fine.I'll need to do this again. I use Glympse on solo motorcycle rides a lot. So, WTF was that and how should I avoid it next time? Just continue unpairing the watch from my phone menu before sending a Glympse, or is there a better way?",garmin

Can't calibrate Vivoactive 3 Treadmill run,"I used to be able to calibrate my Treadmill run with the ""..."" option a few weeks ago.

The HR / Calorie tracker on my Vivomove HR is way off,"I previously owned a Microsoft Band and a Vivosmart HR and would average around 600-700 calories burned for my workouts.  My routine at the gym has not changed, but the readings on the Vivomove HR are waaaaay off from what I previously would see.  For example, today it is showing I burned 116 calories over an hour which is basically impossible as my workouts are relatively intense.  My arms are pretty hairy, so Id wear my previous two devices on the underside of my wrist, but the Vivomove HR looks pretty silly if Im not wearing it as its intended and kind of defeats the purpose of having the watch, as its difficult to read/use upside down.  Ive read from others that arm hair shouldnt make much of a difference for most fitness trackers, so Im kind of at a loss.I love the watch otherwise, but tracking my workouts is the primary reason I bought it.

Forerunner 235 wasn't syncing with latest version of Garmin Connect. Connect to PC fixed it.,"This might help someone, I hope, as I've seen a lot of posts on Reddit and Twitter about people having sync issues with Garmin products since the last app update on the 22nd of January 2018. Quick background, one of my dogs chewed my Vivoactive HR to death a few months ago. It always worked as expected but I took a while to replace and it but I purchased a FR235 on Amazon a week ago as it was 200 down from the list price of nearly 300. Great deal! So I get the watch and reinstall Garmin Connect app clean to my Android phone, but it won't sync properly. I think a lot of people have had this problem.I read some fixes that helped a bit like disabling app overlay and re-pairing BlueTooth. But if I wanted a run or just the days stats to appear I had un-pair, re-pair and then it would sync once.Now it occurred to me that I update the Garmin GPS head unit on my BMW R1200 motorcycle using my laptop and a PC version of Garmin Connect so I thought there might be something I could do there, so usb connected the FR235 to the laptop and fired up the Garmin Connect software. After logging in to Garmin with my account and getting the software to recognise the watch, it reported that the watch was up to date and everything was fine and the watch was running the latest version of firmware 7.60. I was a bit disappointed tbh as I was hoping for some great reveal. So I disconnected the watch.Then the magic happened. The FR235 updated. To version 7.60 and now everything works!I reconnected the watch and read through the error and sync logs. The version of firmware that the watch shipped with was 7.04. This wasn't able to accept the update file to upgrade the watch to version 7.60 which obviously works with the latest phone version of Garmin Connect released on the 22nd of January.TL;DR if you're suffering from the sync issue post 22nd of January 2018, try installing the Garmin Connect app on a PC or Mac and update your device that way, circumventing the BT problem.HTH someone.",garmin

HR spiked above normal maximum for first ~5 min. came back down to normal after. Wondering if there is some calibration happening for first few runs.Day 2:Ant+ HR disconnected from Concept 2 rowing machine. HR was way too low (expected to be off, but making the note).First Treadmill run, pace was off (to be expected before calibration).For last 7 minutes of 20 minutes of treadmill run, the pace, cadence and heart rate remained completely static (despite me increasing TM rate steadily .1 MPH each minute until 20). Time and distance continued to move (meaning watch was not locked up)Later, I deleted indoor rowing activity from connect. Uploaded TCX from concept2 logbook, which increased daily cals burned in connect. Cals burned never updated on watch despite several synchs.Day 3: Went for outdoor run. First 15 min of run, my heart rate was 10-20 bpm too high (but consistent). After ~15 min, it dropped right down and stayed what I've come to know as accurate.Overall:Watch Face HR refresh rate is low. Digic face, updates approx once a minute. (read this is limitation of Garmin API to conserve battery).So these are some of the things that bugged me. The biggest is heart rate during a run taking a long time to ""correct itself"". Should I expect this behavior to continue, or is it expected for first few activities? I've seen reviews that note the running HR is almost spot on to a chest strap. I haven't worn my Polar H7 simultaneously to compare, but I'm fairly certain the VA3 becomes accurate after some time during the running activites, but not right away, and I think taking 10-15 min to lock on is excessively long. Any thoughts? Thanks.",garmin
Sapphire screen vs sand,"I switched from a 935 to a Fenix 5 (non) because of durability.  I am a beach volleyball coach so I am in the sand everyday.

Garmin Connect Data Analysis,"I've had my watch for about a year and a half now.  Is there a way to compile the data from every run to analyze on a larger scale for things like the following: what is my average pace when the weather or temperature is ""x""?  Do I run slower when it's colder/hotter?  Do I run faster at a particular time of day?  What is my average pace when the humidity is above 75%?  Do I run fast when wearing a certain shoe?Is there any way to compile the vast amount of runs the I have to take a look at data in this way or am I stuck looking at each individual run for the most part?",garmin

How to see workout results in Garmin Connect,"Hi everyone, I just got a Forerunner 235 and am in the process of deciding whether or not to keep it (vs my current Apple Watch). One of the things that really draws me to it is the workout feature-being able to program in a workout and having it prompt me at the appropriate times. However, I cant seem to figure out how to view my results in the context of that workout after having done it. For instance this morning I programmed a workout for 3mi warmup, 5 mi at 10m/mi and 2 mi cooldown. I ran it and it prompted me perfectly and I finished the run. When I go into Garmin Connect I can see lap times but its doesnt separate like the workout. Id expect to also have avg pace warmup, avg pace for the 5, etc. I havent done an interval workout yet but if I did 4x800 for example Id want to see pace separated into the 800 not mile averages. Do you have to manually press lap to get that info even if you programmed it in? Feeling lost with such a different system!",garmin
Help Decoding Recovery advisor graphic,"I've looked high and low for documentation on this and hope the Reddit hive-mind can help.

The first photo was snapped minutes after completing my ride. I have two questions:The ring is dividing into 12 segments like a clock, but the intervals don't seem to correspond to hours.

What do you use your device for?,"I bought a Vivosmart HR and after 5 months I am not really sure why I actually did.The most important feature I was expecting to use was the move bar. However, the fact that not always when the ""move"" triggers I can actually walk, it sort of made me lose instant response every time I see it. Also, it's kind of annoying to get distracted while driving. ""Move""; sorry mate, I cannot leave my car in the middle of the highway and go for a walk.Another one I was interested in: Smart alarm to wake up based on light sleep cycle. Disappointed to see this feature doesn't even exist. I used to have a much cheaper Jawbone UP2 which did an awesome work in this way. Anyway, my bad on buying the watch before checking specs.Heart rate? I guess you have to be a hard/pro athlete to make this worth. Has this ever made some difference to you? I mean, ok, if I see my bpm are on 200 I know I will stop my activity not to die of a heart attack. Otherwise, I don't see a thing here.So, for me it's basically a watch you have to charge every 5 days. And when I do, I may forget it plugged for hours which makes my step count for that day useless.Waterproof? Maybe, but I prefer taking it off every time I clean dishes or have a shower. If not, my wrist keeps uncomfortably humid. And again, I forget to wear it immediately back to count steps accurately.So, any advise to make the most of this or other similar Garmin watch?",garmin

Vivosmart HR - Alarm issues (and suggested fix?),"Hi. This is my first post here, so be gentle :-)I have a Vivosmart HR, which I also use as an alarm to get me up in the morning. However, more often than not (or liked), the alarm does not go off when it should. And therefore I've overslept a few times :-(Today I noticed what caused this. The screen is so sensitive that if I in any way touch the screen when the alarm is supposed to go off, it will register as dismissal or snooze. For instance: If my arm is covered due to my head resting on it, or I turn over (maybe because of the alarm starting), it will be instantly dismissed.As I see it there is a very easy solution to this, and one others (like Samsung Gear Fit) already has implemented:  Swipe up to dismiss and swipe down to snoose. Anyone know why this isn't implemented, or another workaround to the problem? Help is much appreciated, since I very much like my little gadget :-)",garmin
Questions about rep counting on the Vivosmart 3,"Hello all, I just purchased my first Garmin fitness tracker, the vivosmart 3, and so far Im pretty happy.

Is there any way to break it down into sets and reps for specific exercises. I had the rep counted on the whole time I was in the gym and just kept clicking start and stop every time I started and ended a new set. Is that how youre supposed to use it?

Other than that, any more tips for just using the tracker in general? So far I seem to like it. Any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you!

Forerunner 35 battery life after update,"I've had my Forerunner 35 for about a year, and haven't had any issues. Saturday night (3-3-18) it updated. The software it's running now is V3.2. I looked up the update and it seems to be from a few months ago, which I thought was weird, but didn't look into it at all.   After the update, the battery life seems to be significantly worse than it used to be. Monday morning I went on a run. At the beginning of the run I had 1 bar on the battery left.

It's down to half battery now (Wed midday). I used to be able to get at least a week out of it without needing to charge with no running or GPS tracking.It is connected to my phone, but I haven't used it any more than a usual day.

The internal file system does contain critical files and there is no way to restore them self serve or remotely.  The chat support person offered a $99 RMA solution.  I called support and explained the issue, much friendlier gentleman explained they used to be able to restore remotely(my guess is when they had the web updater prior to Garmin Express) and offered to waive the $99 RMA.

Swimming Heart rate Vivoactive 3 after patch,"I am aware of the fact that the Vivoactive 3 shuts off its heart rate sensor while swimming, it even says it before your swimming workout.

Since the last patch the sensor actually turns off and it shows a gap in the heart rate graph after a swimming workout. But why? The watch is clearly capable of measuring my heart rate while swimming. Even if its not accurate, its still interesting data to see. Why doesn't Garming change the message before the workout to something like: ""Note: Heart Rate during swimming is inaccurate"" and keep the sensor on.

Coming from Withings,"Hello Garmin users. I currently have a Withings/Nokia Steel activity tracker; it's quite basic, tracking steps and sleep. I also have the Withings/Nokia scale. I'm curious to see if any of you came from that platform and moved over to Garmin. I'm looking at getting a new activity tracker/fitness watch but one that has an HR monitor for all day HR tracking. I was looking at the Nokia one, but it seems to grab a heart rate reading only every 5-10 minutes, which doesn't seem all that useful overall. I'm looking at the Vivomove HR, VivoActive 3, or Fenix 5. I want to stick to the round watch face, and be able to give it a somewhat traditional analog look. I do like that all of these allow you to connect a chest strap HRM to it when doing workouts for more accurate tracking during that time, and using the optical built-in one for the rest of the time.Will I still be able to use and sync my Withings scale in the Garmin ecosystem (willing to use a middle man app if needed), or would I have to enter my morning readings manually?Also, I quite enjoy the sleep tracking and silent alarm for waking up. As part of this, I can give my watch a time 'window' to wake me up at an opportune time when I'm in a light sleep, rather than just waking me at one specific time. Do the Garmin devices I listed above have that feature as well? If so, can I do multiple alarms for different days (ie: weekdays at one time window and weekends at another) [Nokia doesn't do this; it's one alarm only, but I would like the ability to have more than one]?",garmin

Garmin Forerunner 645M crashed AGAIN (review vs the TomTom Runner 3 + HR + Music) (x-Post r/running),"Got my first running watch, the TomTom Runner 3 + HR + Music a year ago, and switched to the FR 645M a week ago. Was thinking of writing up a comparison anyway, and this crash has just given the impetus. Here are my headlines:Switched a week ago and have run a fair bit since, so good feel for the watchesFunctionally, there is no real difference between the 2 devices. If you are price sensitive I'd highly recommend the TomTom over the Garmin - it's great just feels a bit clunky in comparisonPOSITIVES FOR THE GARMINThe Garmin is more 'polished' and does have a great user experience when it actually works. I'd compare it to using a Mac vs PC, for general use. They basically do the same thing but you appreciate the small touches and build quality with a MacGarmin watch UX is fantastic and super intuitiveAs a piece of hardware it feels really well-built, solid buttons and good weightWhen auto-sync over Wi-Fi works, it's really seamless and the one actual benefit over the TomTom which can't do thisGarmin Connect is good and the workout design and upload is great, aside from you can't set auto-lap functionality within the workout on Garmin ConnectNEGATIVES FOR THE GARMINAuto-lapping during a work out. I'm just so confusedMy interval sessions go warm up - time-based intervals w/ rest - cool down. I want km splits to display on the watch all the way through (or maybe restarting at beginning of each interval), but for the session overview on Strava I just want km splits for the warm up and cool down, and then average speed for the intervals / rests in chunks. I have no idea how to do this on the Garmin.With the TomTom it just worked. If anyone could help here I'd be so grateful. But my point is a) you should be able to set this up in the workout on Garmin Connect b) it's really not intuitive - I have no idea what happens if I turn off auto-lap during a custom workout - will it tell me km splits?It says that it turns off during a workout, but it didn't for me.GPS on the Garmin is glitchy - have had a few randomly stupidly quick splits which haven't happened with the TomTom, plus the TomTom connected to GPS far quicker for meAnd finally - the Garmin has crashed twice in the week when uploading to Wi-FiI'll come back after a session and it won't sync. Then if I look on the watch menu it will be stuck on 'sync in progress'. Then if I turn it off it won't turn on again. This is not a battery issue. Last time it took an hour for it to come back on again. The time was wrong but it was fine aside from that. It's currently switched off and not switching back on so will let you know how that goes... Tried to put a message on the Garmin forum but that's buggered too.(Update - it turned back on after 2 hours of trying)Any questions feel free to ask!EditAnother negative i forgot - wired connection to Garmin Express on the computer is totally hit and missYou need to use a wired connection to add music to the device (if you're not using one of the streaming services it offers). To do this you need to use Garmin Express, which looks a bit clunky but is perfectly serviceable. More importantly - whether the watch actually connects is totally hit and miss. Of the 5 times or so I've tried to connect, it worked smoothly a couple but more often than not it's a 20-minute effort of plugging in, removing, turning off and on, hoping and wishing, then lo and behold it connects",garmin

Garmin can't combine the data from 2 watches,"I have two watches, one is a Fenix 2 which I use when I run, and another is the FR 35 which I use for all other cases. The FR 35 tells me how many steps I've made, how active I've been etc.The Fenix 2 doesn't count steps, but since it knows my cadence it could calculate it based on that.Anyway today the not-so-unusual situation happened that I ran a marathon with the Fenix 2, after finishing it I took on the FR 35, and a few minutes later I get a warning telling me to start moving. Fine, so it's just the watch. But then I go to Garmin Connect website. It tells me today I only did 6000 steps (which is too low). If you just do the basic math of time x cadence/min then you'll get I did around 40248 on the marathon alone.It doesn't have to get it right. It just needs to stop the bulls*t. Just add 40K to my 6000 and I'll be happy. I mean these are expensive watches, it's not too much to ask to get some basic things right.",garmin

Buy a Garmin Fenix 3HR or a 5X,"Hey everyone, I have been looking at getting a new watch and am trying to decide between the 3HR and the 5X. I have never had a smart watch before, I have been wearing the same cheap G Shock for years. I work out 5ish days a week, a mix between running, weight lifting, and high intensity circuit based stuff. I also like to cycle occasionally. I'm not an elite athlete by any means, but I would like to be able to track my metrics and see where I can improve. I definitely like the Saphire screen, my job is very physical and I would ideally like to wear the watch 24/7, including work. My current watch is beat up and has a scratch across the screen. I don't know if I should go the cheaper route and get the 3HR or just commit and get the 5X. The biggest pro I see for the 5X is the added data for workouts and also the maps. I do love to go hiking/backpacking and i usually go on a 3 or 4 day backpacking trip every year. How useful is the map feature though? Realistically I use a handheld Garmin GPS on my backcountry trips and my phone when I'm around time. I could see it being useful in an emergency if my phone dies or if I'm out running or biking, especially in an area I'm not familiar with. Mostly I'm the kind of guy who has the fear of missing out, I was dead set on the 3HR ubtil I started to see all of the features of the 5X. I wanted to get opinions from people who own both watches, is the 5X worth the price? Will I be disappointed if I get the 3HR? Size isn't a huge issue for me, but also if the 5X is so ungainly on my wrist that could be an issue.",garmin

"Can't decide between VA3, FR 235 and FR 735XT","I'm interested in buying a sport watch, and after some research, my options are those 3 (maybe Fenix 3 too if it's worth).My main sports are surf, trail running and OCR. I'm interested mostly for running, although either option is waterproof so I will not have any issues using it while surfing.Currently, in Amazon Spain these are the prices:FR 235 219.99FR 735XT 299VA3 299Fenix 3 HR 324.99About the VA3, in Amazon it has very poor reviews compared to the 235 and 735XT, and I see many people complaining specially about the battery. Also, I read that the lack of hardware buttons make it harder to manage it  while running. However, it's the newer of the three, so I expect its support to be longer. Garmin Pay could be very good, but neither it's implemented yet in Spain nor I'm a customer of the only bank that will offer such service, so that's not a perk for me.The FR 235 seems to be the rock solid option. Lot of good reviews, lot of users without issues, but... it's a bit dated, and I don't want to buy something that I'd have the feeling of needing to replace it in a year.Finally, the FR 735XT, originally the most expensive of the 3 options but nowadays at the same price of the VA3, so maybe it's worth a shot.",garmin
vivoactive hR no longer works after going in pool,"Went to the pool a few days ago, and the watch messed up after being in the pool.

"Unable to connect to Garmin Connect or Garmin Express, customer support unresponsive.","Hello everyone,I was given a Garmin vivomove HR as a gift about 2 weeks ago. Sadly, it wouldn't connect to my smartphone through Garmin Connect. After a bunch of trials, I called the customer service and a very nice person said that since they themselves just acquired an off brand chinese phone, they'd give it a try and in the meantime, they'd shoot me an email so I could send them all the technical infos. I never heard from that person again.I sent a couple mails to through the support form, with all the steps I had taken and all the technical info, and never got any response from there either.On my side, I did some research and found out that Huawei phones were having trouble connecting with Garmin watches, and I extrapolated that other lesser known chinese brands might have had the same problem. The software update 3.70 seemed to fix (partially?) this issue so I went on to try and update my watch (running 3.60). I paired the watch with my sister's phone without any issue (cheap Samsung phone) but it wouldn't update the watch.I then tried to connect the watch to my computer directly through Garmin Express but it didn't even recognize that the watch was plugged in. So, starting to feel lost, I purchased an ANT+ USB thingy (which it turns out is useless for that purpose, $15 down the drain...). I then tried again to connect the watch to my computer through Garmin Express, and this time it did recognize it. However, I cannot connect to my Garmin account on Garmin Express because apparently ""servers are unavailable at the moment"" (this might not be the exact error message, but it wasn't much more detailed than that). And after a few trials, I never got any further.So right now, I have this very nice looking $200 gift that's irritating my wrist and does little less that any $2 from aliexpress.

[Help/Bug] Fenix3 HR defaulting to HR widget instead of Watchface,"I'm experiencing an incredibly annoying bug atm. I installed an app (GymGenius) on my Fenix3 and tried setting some favourite apps and all of a sudden the watch's default home screen is the HR widget, not the Watch Face. Wtf.

Garmin HRM Run Help,"Hi guys,My gf uses a FR735XT and HRM run. Battery was only replaced a few weeks ago. It seems a bit intermittent, in that she ran hard intervals today but her HR didn't get out of Z1. Zones are setup correct and she should have been a lot higher. Her graph shows there was HR movement (no cut outs or steep drops) but it didn't move like you'd expect to see during intervals...Can anyone shed some light on this?

Should I get HRM-Run or Polar H10 to pair with Garmin 935,"I'm currently looking to add a chest strap heart rate monitor to my tools for training, however I'm slightly torn between two decisions.I currently own a Garmin 935 and am looking at getting a HRM-Run or Polar H10. I initially opted for the HRM-Run however for some reason many retailers are out of stock in Asia (which is where I am). I'm slightly tempted to get a polar H10 as it's about the same price range and widely known for being the best HRM around...My questions are, do I lose any metrics by pairing with the Polar H10 instead of the Garmin HRM? Garmin HRM-Run claims to be able to provide more running dynamics with their HRM. Is Polar capable of doing the same? Does the H10 provide other statistics other than Heart rate and HRV if I use it on a Garmin 935?Hoping you guys can help with my decision making. Thanks!",garmin

Strongly considering a Vivoactive HR. Owners - What's your experience been?,"I've had two Fitbit Charge HRs. First got one in June 2016 and replaced it under warranty May 2017. Now my second one is screwed up. Both times there have been issues with the face cracking - and I'm not hard on the devices. While it still tracks stuff for now, the build quality is pretty pathetic. The back of the display literally separates from the front. I'm sure I could superglue it or something, but I shouldn't have to.Since I'm out of warranty, Fitbit gave me a coupon for 25&#37; off. Nice gesture, but I'm not sure I really want to give them more money. I've noticed that I can get a Vivoactive HR for about $150 on clearance. There's no way I can justify the Fenix or other high-end devices.I mostly walk a lot, and I'm up and down a lot of flights of stairs during the day. Work day I can easily hit 25 on my Charge HR. Because I have garbage knees and have other issues, I do not run. I can walk forever but running makes me wish for the sweet release of death.So questions:How accurate are the steps on the Vivoactive HR?How accurate are the flights of stairs?How's the build quality? Can I expect it to last more than 10 months?How is the app compared to Fitbit?Can the display be turned off at night? My wife is a light sleeper and the light from my Charge HR can wake her up if I forget to turn off the ""raise to wake"" function.I know the Vivosmart 3 covers lots of these features, but considering the clearance price of the Vivoactive HR I'm intrigued.

Any thoughts?I just converted from Polar Flow, and I have to admit that service, while not as detailed as Garmin Connect, is a hell of a lot smoother when it comes to interacting with other services like Strava, Apple Calendar and the like.",garmin

Question about Connect Calendar Workouts,"Hi all, I use the Garmin Connect Calendar to schedule my running workouts for the month. I have a long list of workout types, each based on distance, speeds, intervals, run types, etc. The list is now fairly substantial, and to see all the workouts you have to scroll down on the calendar page, resulting in the calendar moving out of view altogether. By the time you see the bottom workouts, the calendar is gone and you can't drag and drop the workouts on to the calendar.Has anyone else faced this? Is there a solution? If Garmin put the workouts in a frame that scrolled separately that would solve the problem, but I doubt they're going to implement this for me overnight :) . I can post a screenshot if anyone isn't sure what I'm talking about.Edit: looks like also flagged as an issue on Garmin Forums, although no idea if Garmin checks those.https://forums.garmin.com/forum/into-sports/garmin-connect/troubleshooting/1341543-scheduling-workouts-please-fix",garmin

Taiwanese vs USA version? Vivoactive 3,"I'm traveling Asia for a really long time, possibly until the next US presidential cycle. I lost my Forerunner 235 recently, and I miss it.

How do i Measure and View my HRV using my Fenix 5 and a Garmin Chest Strap Heart Rate Monitor,"I want to start using Heart Rate Variability (HRV) to log my recovery between training sessions. It seems like an important physiological measurement that's getting a lot of attention recently.However, I can't seem to find a straightforward way to access the measurement with my Garmin Fenix 5. Just to clarify, I have a Garmin ANT+ chest strap heart rate monitor (HRM) as well.The closest I can find is a stress number which isn't really what I'm looking for. I want HRV - similar to what Elite HRV measures using bluetooth enabled chest HRMs measures. HRV4Training also measures HRV using a phones camera but I'd like to use my Garmin chest strap for this which should be a lot more accurate and should hopefully integrate with all of the other measurements in my Connect app.Confusingly, there's an option on the Fenix to ""Log HRV"" but I can't seem to find it displayed anywhere!",garmin

"Those who do Strength Training, do you bother use the rep counter?","I've got a Garmin 5 and I do strength training about five days a week but I've noticed that it can be a of pain in the ass to continuously baby my watch whenever working out. My 'workflow' goes like this; Go to Strength App --&gt; Start App --&gt; Back button for 1st set --&gt; Do my set --&gt; Press Stop --&gt; Adjust the amount of reps (I do a lot of dumbbell workouts so it gets confused a lot) --&gt; Skip the part where it says adjust the weight --&gt; Then wait until I'm ready and restart for each set. After, I go into the Connect App and I've got the right amount of reps because I've adjusted it, but every labelled workout is pretty much incorrect.. It's so tedious to change the name/weight in the Connect App especially when you've done like 24 sets and have to adjust each one. I think it would be a cool feature if it actually worked and I give props to Garmin because its pretty accurate when it comes to Push-ups and basic machinery gym equipment, but its near impossible to detect accuracy with dumbbell works and I can't really blame them.  I've come to the point where I just switch off the rep counter and just use it to record my workouts and monitor heart-rate, time taken and calories etc. What do you all do? **TLDR:**.

Strength training workaround,"I've seen conplaints about the strength mode and I agree that double tapping in between each set is tedious. When I'm lifting all I want is a decent HR measurement, time and rough estimate of calories. Reps is not something that interests me since I do mostly compound movements for low reps. If this sounds like you I have a workaround for you.You need to create a strength workout and just add one workout step. I picked either squat or deadlift. When it asks you for the target type choose lap button press. This allows you to just press the button to start and stop the workout. I created 3 different workouts for the main movements.I'm unable to change the first data field in the strength app but I made the 2nd one all about HR. It's only gonna record one long set so if you care about rep accuracy or rest time this isn't for you. This will just save you the time of constantly switching the activity type to strength in the app.I have the vivoactive 3.",garmin

Vivosmart 3 account registration,"Hey! I bought an used vivosmart 3 today for a pretty cheap price where I live (Argentina). It's in pretty good shape, the guy told me he had only used it a couple of times. It doesn't feel much used either, it even has that ""new"" smell. Thing is, I synced it to my phone (already have a FR235) and I got a warning about it being registered to another account. I figured it was obvious since it was an used device. I reseted it and it synced to my account just fine (I even got an email about the new registration) Is there any possibility it's still being synced to the old account too? I don't know if the guy removed it from his account, but since the warning popped up I guess he didn't. I read a couple forum posts of devices appearing in old accounts. It doesn't have GPS so I guess I don't care about he tracking me or anything, but I wouldn't like he tracking my steps and all that.

Wrist HR Monitor on Fenix 5,"Hi guys, I purchased my Fenix 5 a few months ago and love it. I wear it all day every day. The only thing I find curious is the wrist HR monitor. I run Spartan races and use the watch to help my track my training whether its lifting, running/trail running, indoor running, elliptical, etc. What I find curious is how low my watch is telling me my HR is during my workouts. It is usually fairly accurate during my outdoor running/ trail running, but its real low during weight lifting, elliptical, indoor running, etc. I know the wrist HR monitor is never 100% accurate, but it seems to be a lot lower then it should. For instance, it shows during an elliptical workout when Im breathing hard that my HR is only 84-86 bpm, but when I check my HR on the elliptical machine it shows 140-150 bpm. Before I had the Fenix 5 I had the TomTom Spark. That wrist HR monitor matched fairly well with the elliptical machine bpm. I know people are going to say to get a HR strap but I feel it will just get in the way during other various activities. Is anyone else having these issues on their Fenix 5 or is this normal?Thanks everyone!",garmin

Vivoactive 3 real-world GPS battery life?,"I replaced my awful Fitbit Surge with a Vivoactive 3 a few weeks ago. So far so good, for the most part.I know the specs claim 13 hours of battery life when using GPS, but all the discussion I've read says that's unrealistic. So what is realistic?I just went on a 2h13m bike ride, starting at 100% battery and ending at 76%. Doing a simple linear extrapolation, that works out to 9h14m (2h13m = 133m. 133m / 24% = 554m = 9h14m). Is this realistic? I'm going to be doing some pretty long rides in the next couple of weeks so I'm curious about when I should expect to need to bring a charger with me in order to record long rides.update: I just biked 4h25m, and my watch went from 100% down to 49%. That extrapolates out to 8h40m. So assuming the bottom half of the battery discharges at the same rate as the top half, somewhere between 8.5 and 9.5 hours of GPS time on a full charge seems realistic with my setup.",garmin

Vivomove HR - Heart Rate Inaccuracy,"I recently purchased a Vivomove HR and so far really love the aesthetics and the functionality, however the heart rate monitor has been wildly inaccurate. I tested it last week on the elliptical, and my heart rate was averaging around 90 bpm, but using the hand grip HR sensor on the elliptical I was seeing a heart rate between 130-170 bpm (which seems accurate). I tested the accuracy again over the weekend, wearing my new Vivomove HR on one wrist and my old Vivosmart HR+ on the other for a bike ride. The results from the two were wildly different - the vivomove gave me an average of 80 bpm, and the vivoactive an average of 140 bpm. Considering I have tested my Vivosmart against other cadio equipment in the past and found the result to be relatively accurate, it leads me to believe that the Vivomove HR sensor is not working properly or just not as accurate. A few observations:When on the ellitical, my heart rate was essentially at resting for most of the exercise, until I let my arm hang - then my heart rate shot up to what I felt was accurate. As soon as I grabbed the handles again, heart rate dropped. Could be the wrist orientation? Although this was never an issue with the Vivosmart and you wouldn't think should affect the device.The second test was cycling, so again, the wrist angle could have been affecting the sensor's ability to detect HR, however the Vivosmart had no such issues.I actually did a third test, going for a hike, where my heart rate average was 102 on the Vivomove and 119 on the Vivosmart, giving me a 500 calorie difference over the course of the hike - not an insignificant variance. So with a hanging wrist, the sensor was more accurate but still a good amount off from the vivosmart.Software is up to date with version 3.70.Has anyone else experience HR accuracy issues with the Vivomove HR? This could be a deal breaker for me, as heart rate is the only way to track a lot of my activities that are undetectable by steps (such as biking, or elliptical). I really love this device otherwise so I hope I can find an explanation or a solution.Thanks for help!",garmin

"Fenix 5 - GPS ""cutting corners"" on hikes/runs/etc even in open areas","I've been using the Fenix 5 since late January (replaced a suddenly dead vivoactive HR) and I've been impressed with its functionality and hard wearing exterior. I chose it over the 935 specifically for its exterior (mountain biking, hiking, climbing, trail running, bush bashing in areas where there are plenty of rocks and things to scratch a nice watch!! Plus I am a gumby so I've had many opportunities to scratch it) I have noticed however, that the GPS seems to ""cut corners"" on some of my hikes/trail runs. This is even in areas with clear vision of the sky (so not in canyons/thick tree cover/deep gullys) I will occasionally feel the watch buzz to tell me it has stopped tracking even when I am walking on a clear, wide forest management trail. Interestingly - it doesn't seem to lose any tracking or ""cut corners"" when I am mountain biking in the same area but under thick tree cover or in deep gullys. I've upgraded the firmware - still no improvement. Any suggestions? Is this one a dud and should I get it replaced under warranty? Thanks :)",garmin

My experience switching from the Apple Watch S3 to the Garmin Fenix 5.,"Hey everyone,I thought I'd share my thoughts and opinions since I made the switch from Apple Watch S3 (Nike, non-LTE) to my Garmin Fenix 5 (Non-sapphire) about two months ago for any of you people considering making the switch. I'd also love to hear all your thoughts too! I am just an average user who is not a fitness fanatic but I do like to train once a day adleast whether it is Gym, Running, Trail riding, basketball.Pros of the Garmin Fenix 5 over the Apple Watch S3:Aesthetics/Design. My biggest gripe with the Apple watch was its design. I really dislike how ""'techy/nerdy' it can come off as, a bright square shining up on your wrist every moment, there is no circular option, there is no 'rugged' option. After breaking my S2 Apple watch because it dropped of my charger a metre high and shattered the screen was really annoying, imagine taking it to a job that is prone to smacking your watch (Tradesmen, mechanics, emergency workers etc).. Or if you are into sports like Mountain bike riding etc. For someone who wore a G-shock for this reason makes the Apple watch really hard to use as a daily. The Garmin Fenix 5 absolutely nails this, it is both rugged and circular, an optional size for people (5S, 5X and several other garmins for other wrist sizes) and it feels much more like a regular watch. I do not get anyone saying ""Oh neat, apple watch, what does it do?"" Which is what I want. That being said, I'm not saying that the Apple watch is ugly, It looks amazing on my partner and she really likes it and would never wear something like my Fenix 5.. I just like having the options that Garmin provide.Watch faces. Adding on from the above point, the watch faces on the Apple watch were extremely infuriating, many of them are locked into you purchasing a specific model (Nike, Hermes), even the damn nike watch cost the same as a regular S3 but for some reason you cant get that face on the regular S3 (?????). There are a huge limitation in faces, it is locked down and not open to 3rd party developers like Garmin, Fitbit, Android, Tizen etc.. Majority of the faces do NOT match a square shape, they are very controlling with what you can put and where, and Apple's focus on disney characters is cute and all, but not everyone wants to rock 'cute' on their wrist. The watch face store on the Garmin is not perfect and there are a lot of BAD ones, but there are also plenty of great ones, I'm perfectly fine with the stock one as it shows everything I want exactly.Always on display.This is seriously underrated, it was awkward and annoying having to always raise my wrist on the Apple watch, something I think should be the first most important aspect of a watch after all. It is nice to just look down at my wrist and see the time.More fitness options. Obviously Garmin is the king of fitness and is the recommended ""go-to"" for people who take fitness very seriously. However, for an average user like my self I will just say that I was content with what Apple has to offer, so everything Garmin has to offer is just better. I like how there are a lot more sport options such as MTB, Strength where as on the Apple watch there isn't. Rep counting was cool while it lasted but I found it very gimmicky and un-useable. If you are a serious athlete then the Apple watch isn't even a question with what Garmin has to offer, however as a average user I am most probably limiting my Garmin Fenix 5's capabilities.Quick-fit straps. These are MUCH easier to switch and I much prefer this over pressing that little button on the Apple watch to switch out straps.Battery life. I'm not going to lie, I don't really care for the battery life as I take my watch off at night, and the sleeping option is great and I've tried it a few times but I find it quite uncomfortable to sleep with on at night. Although, for those who do want to track sleeping and want to charge their watch less, the Garmin Fenix 5 is king here as well.Cross compatibility. I like iPhones, but I also like Android phones and often switch back and fourth. Not being tied down to just iOS is a good feeling, my next phone can be anything I want and not have to worry about my watch supporting it or not.Pros of the Apple Watch S3 over the Garmin Fenix 5:The display. It's brighter, the colours and OLED are just beautiful to look at, I still get jealous when I see my partners Apple watch. Automatic brightness is also really good on the AW. Once it gets pretty dark/dim you can barely see the time on the Fenix 5 without pressing the light button.Software. I really like the watch app over Garmins, I really like how I can change the faces and download apps directly through the app, using the IQ app store on Garmins or changing stock faces having to use through the buttons on the watch is silly.Notifications. I don't really care for notifications, but you do have much more control with what notifications can be previewed on the Apple watch (on iOS) as the Garmin app will NOT let you pick what notifcations/previews you can control  (Not on android though).Price. The Garmin Fenix 5 retails for $799 AUD, I happen to get it on a sale for $599 AUD, but even then the Apple watch S3 42mm retails for $499 AUD.Wireless charging. Yes it has inferior battery life but for someone who does not need the sleeping features it is easier to just throw it on the wireless charging dock.Accessories. Charging Dock? Yes, there are a MILLION accessories for bands/docks/cases/skins etc for the Apple watch. I've been lucky to find THREE alternative bands for my Fenix 5, no charging dock so far either.A few points:If I could go back in time, I would still pick my Garmin Fenix 5 as well - I just wish the display was brighter/crispier and that the Garmin app (on iOS adleast) would get a complete overhaul, it is clunky, slow and the IQ store is terrible to access through it. Let me do more customisations through the app rather then on my actual watch.The Apple watch has a lot of ""Smart-watch"" features like ordering an Uber, using maps, texting/calling your friends.. But honestly, I've TRIED to use apps and features on the Apple watch. It feels like an absolute gimmick to me, it is so much easier to just pull out your phone and use that then trying to do things on a tiny screen on your wrist with one hand. For me (I would argue 90&#37; of smart watch users would agree with this too), all I use my watch for is three things.Checking the time.Glancing for quick info, (Weather, Notifications)Fitness.Going from a touch-screen to a button only watch also felt a bit slower, I would often just swipe and press on the apple watch where as now I have to use a set of different buttons for basic functions however, it does feel more simplistic and feels much more of a ""regular watch"" than a smart-watch which is what I actually wanted in the end.I have yet to meet anyone with an Apple watch (outside of reddit) who actually uses it to call/text/order an uber etc. Yes, you can speak siri to your wrist, but I also did that with my phone (??). At the end of the day, I want a watch with an always on display, a rugged and circular shaped body, great for fitness tracking, lets me know when I have certain notifications or when someone is calling me, easily swaps out bands and thats about it. For me, the Garmin Fenix 5 absolutely nails all of those over the Apple watch (except for the screen and better phone app) and for others its the opposite, all this competition is just awesome for us consumers &gt;:) TLDR: I switched from Apple Watch S3 to Garmin Fenix 5. The Garmin definitely feels more of a regular/sport watch with a great rugged build/aesthetic while the Apple watch feels very techy and is loaded with a bunch of features (that I find useless personally) but I like the apple watch software/display much more.Edit: Fixed some typos.",garmin

Vivosport in water,"I  bought Vvosport a few days ago and am very pleased with its performance as walking, running and sleeping tracker. However I noticed that water activates the display.

How to find up which apps have notifications blocked?,"For a few days now, I'm noticing that I'm no longer receiving WhatsApp notifications in my Vivoactive 3. Emails, Telegram, etc.. are working fine.A few days ago, I saw the icon of upgrading, but I don't know what was upgraded as the version is still the same, 3.50.I think my issue was that I forgot to lock the screen while taking a shower, and it misconfigured a few things (removed stress widget, changed watch face...), so probably, if I received a notification during the shower, it might have ""touched"" in block notifications from this app.I'm trying to find out if that's the case, but I don't see anywhere (neither in the watch nor in Garmin Connect) an option to list which apps are blocked, if any.

Can you save all-day altimeter data?,"I have a 935 (but this should apply to fenixes, or anything else with barometer, or temperature).It records all-day heart beat data, and syncs with Connect, where I can download the .FIT data later.It also seems to passively (as in, not in an activity) record temperature, pressure, and altitude. You can view these using the respective widget pages. Is there a way to download or save this data?I was out and about the other day and got to go from the ground floor of a pretty tall building up on the roof and back.

Which Garmin for cross county?,"Hello! I have no experience with Garmin watches. My son is 14 and just signed up for cross country and they want them to have a watch with gps and heart rate. I have a budget of $150 to maybe $180 for something real good. I started out just going to get him a new forerunner 35 then I saw I could get a used 235 for the same price. Then while looking for a used 235 I realized for like barely any more I can get a used 735xt or Vivoactive 3. Now Ive read reviews and watched videos but honestly I just dont know what to get.He wants one that he plans to wear all the time. He currently has a Fitbit charge 2 that he will be replacing and likes the real watch look like these I mentioned. Any of them will meet his coaches requirements. OH, he does use his Fitbit as his alarm clock to wake him up, he says it vibrating his wrist works better at waking him up! He also uses his phone stop watch to time his workouts like pushups for specific period of time and such like that. So if a watch could easily help him in some of these ways that would be great.Are some easier to use than others? Do you guys have any advice on which watch would be best for him? I want to get something that can grow with him if he decides to get real into the details which is why I was moving from the 35 to the 235. But the used market just has too many great watches between $150-$180Hope you guys can help me decide! Thanks!",garmin

Believe I was sold a Used Garmin Passed Off as New,"I purchased a Garmin Edge 520 in April that was on sale. It was sold to me as new from a shop I go to frequently. Since using it I have had nothing but trouble with it. My second and third rides on it lost GPS signal and ended up with corrupted time data. I have done about 25 rides with it since purchasing and have had issues with half of those. Issues include lost GPS signal, corrupt ride/time data and Strava segment ""drift"".This is my first Garmin and I have never had a Garmin Connect account. HOWEVER, when I setup the device and paired with my phone, it showed a few rides in my Garmin Connect. One each from October and November. I recognize the routes and know those were not ridden by me. When I look at the ride info, it shows it was done with a Garmin Edge 520... but with the 12.30 firmware. When I first powered my device on after purchase, it had me update to 12.60 so I have never done a ride with that firmware. There are 3 rides in there dated on the day that I purchased the device. Only 1 of those are mine... In fact, one of those would have been impossible to have done that day as the trails were still closed here.What am I getting at here... I believe I bought a used Garmin that was passed off as new. I also believe that this device may have been originally returned because of the same issues that I am experiencing.It looks like the ride data was never removed from the device after it was returned. Does this make sense? I want to have my ducks in a row before going in as this is a shop I have done TONS of business with. I have purchased 4 bikes from here in 3 years and tons of other items. Also, would Garmin be able to give me more information if I got a hold of them to further confirm this?",garmin

I have a nuvi 50 lm and I updated it over a year ago and ever since then its been trying to get me to take gravel roads so I called the company and they said  theyve never heard of that and I should just buy a new machine so I finally just did that. I got the drive 50 with lifetime maps and it is also trying to get me to take gravel roads. The unpaved roads, u turns, and carpool lanes are turned on in Avoidances and Ive tried it on faster time and shorter distance and it still does it. I even updated it and it still does it. I cant be the only that has had his trouble. Any help is appreciated. Im going to have to call the company and be put on hold I guess.

VA3 Inaccurate Fitness Tracking,"Hi everyone, I bought a VA3 about 2 weeks ago because I wanted a good all-day fitness tracker that looked nicer than my Fitbit Charge 2. However, so far I've been disappointed with the seemingly inaccurate heart rate and fitness tracking capabilities. I compared my VA3 to my Charge 2 during two strength training sessions and one HIIT cardio workout (wearing one on each wrist for the duration of the workouts), and the VA3 didn't count as many steps or nearly as many calories burned as the Charge 2. This was despite following the recommendation of keeping the VA3 tight but not constricting during workouts.My question is two-fold:is there a way to improve the fitness tracking of the VA3? For example, does it just need more data from my workouts to track them more accurately, or do I need to tweak a setting?am I just putting too much stock in the accuracy of my Charge 2? I have a tough time believing it since it's consistently rated as one of the best, and my VA3 said I only burned 250ish calories during a 90 minute intense workout, but I'm interested to hear about other experiences and thoughts",garmin
Watch isn't syncing workouts,"I created a workout on Garmin Connect, and according to my computer, I synced the workout to the watch from Garmin Express. However, when I look at the workouts of my watch, it's clearly not synced. So I go to Garmin Connect on my iPhone and I try to send the workout via that blue phone icon, but when I press on the icon, nothing is happening. I can confirm that the iPhone is connected to the watch, but the press on the blue icon does nothing. It's weird, the icon will even getting shaded which means the app knows I'm pressing it, but it doesn't go to the next page where I'm supposed to select my device. I have reset the watch twice and nothing has changed. I just went to the Courses section of the app, and I managed to send a course to the phone just fine.",garmin

Garmin FR 935 APAC vs ROW,"I am looking to buy a Garmin FR935 - now there are the 2 versions - Asian (APAC) and Rest of the World (ROW). The Asian is approx 70 cheaper. So the question is, what is the difference?I have found that the languages are Asian and English on the APAC and then all kinds of languages on the RAW. English is fine, so no problem there.APAC gets updates later - how critical is that? My current Garmin is a FR305 - so my last update has been ages ago...And then I found somebody stating that the hardware might be different as well. Now this is the interesting part. Anybody here with more details on that?The question is, if the APAC will cause problems for me in Europe that could prevent me from buying teh 70 cheaper APAC version.Thank you",garmin

Slow notifications on Vivoactive 3?,"Have had my Vivoactive 3 for three days, I'm using Connect on Android. Email notifications are sometimes taking a full minute to reach the watch from my phone (when they are right next to each other). Phone calls are detected in 8-9 seconds which is also slow- in normal situations I wouldn't even have time to get my phone out of my handbag before it goes to voicemail. My main reason for wanting a watch with notifications is that it's impossible to hear my phone ringing when I'm out in a busy place and am carrying my phone in my handbag so this is possibly a dealbreaker.I have my old Vivosmart 3 sitting on my desk waiting for the charge to die as there's no way to turn it off, and its notifications arrive less than a second after they are sent. Is it possible at all that the delay is because Connect is sending notifications to two devices? Is there another fixable problem? Or is this just normal behaviour for the VA3?",garmin

Garmin Calorie Count (Daily),"I recently switched from a Fitbit Ionic to a Garmin VA3. I've noticed a big difference in how each calculates my daily calorie burn and I was curious as to why.Here's what I mean: I usually get at least 10,000 steps a day if not more in general movement and deliberate walking. Fitbit would say I had earned more calories than Garmin does. As an example, about a month ago, I walked about 12,000 steps. Fitbit calculated my day at 2400 calories. Yesterday, I walked 15,000 and the Garmin calculated my day at 2144.I have found that they are similar in count for tracked exercises and BMR (if I did nothing all day) but I am curious about this difference for my overall day.",garmin

Should I buy the Vivoactive 3??,"have been using Fitbit since the Flex. Evenually I got a Surge and I have kept it ever since. I bought an Ionic because it seemed like the natural progression. I am not thrilled with it. I don't like the options and the interface. There are a number of things I don't like. The watch not being on for example. I don't like the wrist action or pushing a button to see the time. I don't like that when I start an exercise the screen will time out. I can hit the left button to see the screen, but I can't hit the button again to close it. I have to wait for it to time out. I don't like that the green HR monitor is always flashing even though I shut off the HR monitor. They are little nitpicky things.Now I am torn. Since I don't like the Ionic that much for the price, should I go for a Garmin Vivoactive 3? What about a Samsung Gear 3? Or do I just say screw it and go back to a Surge even though they are discontinued? The Garmin Fenix looks interesting, but it out of my price range for the most part.What I read about the Vivoactive intrigues me and makes me think that is the one for me. Can you please help me decide?To those who have it, can you tell me how it is, what the options are like and if it has worked or not worked for you,please?Thanks!",garmin

Fenix 5 Plus vs 5X first thoughts - AMA,"I received my 5 plus yesterday and after playing it for less than a day here are my thoughts compared to the 5X it is replacing.First impressions:It (5+) feels a lot smaller than the dimensions indicate.  Although the display is the same size, it looked smaller because of the smaller bezel.  For a couple of activities I wore both watches, one on each wrist.  The 5x was moved to my off-wrist, and felt so much clunker (probably due to both size and unfamiliarity with the watch on that side).  The band feels cheaper. The band is narrower, thinner, and smoother than the 5x band.The buttons feel different.  There is 0.5mm to 1mm of travel before you actually start push the button where there is a tactile ""click"" when you get to the button (after the free travel part).   It is hard to describe, but it almost feels like a two stage button.  I don't like it. They did have to re-design the buttons for the Descent Mk1 scuba diving variant of the 5X, so they might be using that new design.  The 5x buttons would stick at depth due to the pressure.  This may be (I hope) why they feel different.Functionality:The default hot keys changed.  Long pressing the ""down"" button now brings you to Music instead of back to the clock/home.  There are a lot more options for units.  On the 5x you could select which units you wanted for distance separate from the overall units used.  With the 5+ there are many more options.  I really appreciate this since I use an odd mix of metric and imperial.  You can individually set: Distance, Pace, Elevation, Depth, Weight, Height, Temperature, Pressure, and Vert Speed.  I love that Depth can be set to different units than height.  But, since it's not a diving watch, I can't really take advantage of that feature.Some of the data screens I use (DozenRun specifically) shows as not compatible with the 5+, but works fine on the 5x.Accuracy:I did a short run last night (just over 2 miles).  The 5x was set to use GPS and GLONASS and the 5+ was set to use GPS and GALILEO.  Results were about the same.  Both were started and ended together, 5x had a distance of 2.06 vs 2.08 for the 5+.  Looking at the details both were off at different points (showing me running through houses vs on the road).  Neither was consistently off so the pluses and minuses tended to average out.  In general it looked like both under reported distance since they showed more corner cutting (just on different corners).[Edited to add] I also used it at the gym with my strength training.  The automatic rep counter on the 5+ seems to be less accurate than the 5x.  Neither were accurate.  I would need to correct the rep counter about 20% of the time on the 5x, but on the 5+ corrections were needed at least 50% of the time.  Most of the time it over counted reps, but not always.  Exercises where I used the rep counter and it should have been more accurate were shoulder press and dead lifts.Summary.  In general I like the 5+ better.  It is not better on every single dimension, but it definitely adds far more than it takes away.  If I were comparing the 5X MSRP price vs the 5+, I would absolutely recommend the 5+.  Once the 5x starts getting discounted more, it will become a much harder choice.Let me know if you have any questions.",garmin

Calorie Calculation Differences,"Over the past several weeks, I have had the opportunity to use and compare a Fenix 5x, 5+, and 5+ Titanium.  I expected there to be slight differences based on GPS and heart rate measurement differences.  On my last test run, I found differences I couldn't explain.  One watch showed significantly higher calories burned (667 vs 579) for the exact same run.Here is the setup.Watch 1: 5+ SapphireWatch 2: 5+ Titanium SapphireBoth watches were connected to an HRM-Tri so the heart rate data was identical.  I went on a 4 mile low speed jog and there was a 2 second discrepancy between the two watches based on user error of my attempt to start and stop them at the same time.  2 seconds  shouldn't make much of a difference.Watch 1 (regular): Distance measured: 4.20mi Calories consumed: 579Watch 2 (titanium):Distance measured: 4.16miCalories consumed: 667Both watches were tied to the same profile (used my same weight and height) and both used the same heart rate data.

How useful are you finding fenix 5+ maps for running?,"I'm currently deciding between the 645M and Fenix 5S+. I currently run with either an old Microsoft Band 2 or nothing, but I'm starting to get more serious about tracking to help my habit of over-training injury.Running is the only activity I care to seriously track (although I do hike and ski), so in general the Fenix is way overkill.... except that the support for true maps is really tempting me. I've tried dwMaps on the 645 and while ""background maps"" exist now, it seems like a poor substitute.I tend to go on runs with a destination or distance in mind but not always an exact course planned, and today I occasionally find myself pulling out my phone to get myself out of dead ends and such. It seems like the 5+ would be super awesome here.That said, paying an additional $250+ for the Fenix over the 645 seems a bit crazy purely for the maps feature. I have a fitness gear benefit from work that's making me less price-averse, but it's still cash that could go towards other gear.So... how are you enjoying maps on your 5+ while running? Useful? Too small or cumbersome? Do you find yourself still pulling out your phone anyways?",garmin

fenix 5 series: HR failures,"Hi, I am struggling with a incomprehensible and not replicable error that occours througout the whole Fenix series:  HR reading failures after a certain amount of time.

The HR reading of Fenix 5+ broke down to around 55 bpm, where the correct one would have been around 100-110, as recordedwith the Polar H10 and Fenix 5X, see yourself:  https://preview.redd.it/5uzgpi14k4811.jpg?width=738&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=517aee0614a64947ca69198b3819b5b307cde102This very same error already happened on 3 other Fenix watches, that I owned before since February of this year.A Fenix 5, and two 5X's, now the same on the new 5+. I really hoped that this annoying bug is fixed on the new 5+ series.But NO, it obviously is not.  These wrong readings happened on all Fenix watches I owned. I replaced them all within 30 days, but every replacementshowed the same symtoms after some time.   I tried many things:cleaning the watch in water before and after every sessionwearing it on the other armwearing it upside downresetting itNothing helped. The error happens again and again. But not replicable. Sometimes the watch gives correct HR readings, most timesit doesn't.  And we are not talking about a 10&#37; inaccuracy, that would be tolerable, but about 50+&#37;.  I have contacted Garmin Germany support a few times already. They say they are not aware of this problem and nobody elsereported this to them. One of the support staff members said the device is faulty and needs to be replaced. I did this then, butthe error reappared on the replacement as well.So Garmin was not of any help for now.  I was thinking that maybe it has to do with some static load on my skin, depending on what I wear, but also this is notreproducable. Maybe with high humidity (I am at sea lvl, with very high humidity most of the time). But even cleaning itwhen the HR reading is so low doesn't change a thing.  so my questions are:has anybody of you run into this failures of the HR sensor?how can I track this down, so that it becomes reproducable?why isn't Garmin interested to get this fixed?why is it only me that notice this?These watches are expensive and top notch, but with a HR sensor that gives wrong readings on near every walk/hikereally really is not acceptable. All the statistics are wrong,I understand perfectly that a arm worn HR sensor on a watch is never as accurate as chest worn one, but still it shouldwork nicely within a certain range of tolerance. Not in my case and experience with 4 different Fenix 5 models.  What are your suggestions?",garmin

Resurrecting Vivoactive HR?,"Last week I went canoeing with my vivoactive HR, spent a couple minutes in the lake, and found when I got out that my watch was shutting itself down and then unresponsive. I found out afterwards that this doesn't seem to be uncommon; apparently this advertised-as-waterproof watch is anything but. Plenty of reports of watches that failed when they went underwater.I'm pretty certain the watch is outside of warranty. This stinks.After giving it time to dry I've connected it to a charger, with a USB power meter to tell me how much current it's pulling. For the first few times I tried this it seemed to be improving, but now it seems to be just doing the same thing. It generally comes up with a charging icon, pulls 200mA, vibrates a couple times, gives the Garmin logo, goes black, then either just stays black (and power use goes to 0) or repeats the vibrate-logo-black cycle. When its power use goes to 0 - either by itself or because I pulled it off the charger - it takes time before it'll draw any current again.Some people on Garmin fora claimed that attaching, charging, detaching, repeat >50x managed to charge and revive their Vivoactive HRs. I'm not confident that's working for mine, though I haven't been counting. I'd bet that the 'it won't take any charge at all, leave it alone a while and try again' is draining what power is left so it's starting from zero power each time it draws any current.Any ideas?",garmin
Got the Physio TrueUp to work on Fenix 5S and Fenix 5X Plus,"Just thought I'd post it here in order to help other people.

Nothing. Then I browsed the Garmin forums. I found a comment on one thread in the middle of the posts that said they had to enable Physio TrueUp from Garmin Connect as a well, under the device settings. Turns out even though the Fenix 5X Plus has Physio TrueUp enabled and it has synced multiple times that this setting wasn't enabled/mirrored in Garmin Connect.I enabled it from Connect for my Fenix 5X Plus and it has worked well since.TL;DR If your Physio TrueUp doesn't work, check the setting is enabled for both your device/watch and Garmin Connect.",garmin
Garmin Forerunner 220 confuses run/walk,"Hi. I've from a long time a Forerunner 220, but I'm gonna start using it in the next days. I was syncing it with Garmin Connect, sending my workout to the watch. But here comes the problem: on the watch, in the details of my workout, the rest is seen as run. Example: if my workout should be 9x(1 minute of run + 1 minute of walk), I see it on the watch as follows: 9x(1 minute of run + 1 minute of run). The problem isn't just about a bug, is the fact that during the activity is difficult to keep track in mind if I should run or if I should walk. In this case, it's enough to use Intervals and probably I would solve easily, but for more difficult workouts this is not possibile.. does anyone of you know a solution to this problem?

How does Garmin calculate the active calories ?,"My active calories calculated by Garmin seem a bit too high and not very consistent.For example, my activities for today were as follows:Ran 5k -> 456cal (reported by the watch)Walked 4.57k (Watch recorded a total distance of 9.57k)40 minutes of moderate strength trainingThe watch doesnt say how many calories I burned from walking alone. We can get an idea of how much someone of my weight and walking pace (11min/km) would burn walking 1 km from this site. Let's be generous and assume I walked over a surface with a 2% incline throughout; this assumption is not far-fetched as I was walking mostly on a flat road with little to no undulations. The website says a person of my size would burn 86 cal per km. This seems too high given I burned only 456cal in my 5k run (91.2cal/km), but lets still use it Im trying to find the maximum possible value I can get from all my activities. This means I would burn a total of 4.57 * 86cal/km = 393calories. The last activity left is about 40 minutes of moderate strength training. A couple of leg presses here, a couple of lat pull downs there. We're talking here about 80lbs at most in most of these. There's no way I can guess how much calorie I could have burned from these activities because I dont use my Fenix 3 HR strength training activities. The only thing the 3 HR was doing is measure my HR. So, the 3 HR doesn't know I'm lifting or what weights I'm using. I've always heard that weight training doesn't burn that much calories. This website confirms that and claims that a 30 minute moderate workout burns around 150 calories for someone of my weight. So, 40 minutes would be 200 calories.If we now add everything, we end up with 356+393+200=1049. We still have to remember that the watch has no idea I'm doing any strength training activity during this time. Now, the watch says I burned 1,349calories. We know for certain where 456 calories came from. We generously estimated the calories burned from walking and strength training. This still leaves us with 300 calories unaccounted for. In other words, the watch is overestimating my calories burned by over 28%.How do your experiences compare to mine ?Edit: I did a 10k run today (958cal) and a 4.4k walk (378cal, calculated using the method above). I did a couple of crunches and leg raises, so let's generously assume 100cal. That's a total of 1,436. The watch reports 1,844. Surprisingly, that's an overestimation of 28.5%. At this point, I feel safe to multiply all my active calories by 0.72 for more accurate estimates.",garmin
VA3 watch - best for swimming?,"Hello everyoneI'm a bit of a newbie at activity tracking. I bought my first activity tracker a bit over a year ago. It's the TomTom Spark/Cardio 3. I didn't know what to get and all the experiences I read about on the internet confused me even more as to which brand and which kind of watch... So I simply got the TomTom because it's what the guy from the electronics store, who told me he was an avid sportsman, recommended -- and one of my friends already had one and she seemed pretty happy with it. Now, I'm not entirely unhappy with my watch. It does its job pretty okay. I swim a lot and it counts the lengths, distance, etc rather well. However, when I hit the gym, I feel like the heart rate tracker isn't always on point.

After reading up a bit, I'm mostly leaning towards the VA3. I'm just looking for a few more opinions from those of you who have experience with the VA3. Now I have seen (and read) other topics here about the VA3. I wanted to make a topic of my own, however, because I'm mostly interested in knowing how the watch performs in the water.

Accuracy of Inreach Tracking in the rain,"Over the weekend we did a hike in heavy monsoon rain, in a heavily wooded area - but with a clear view of the sky all the same. I have used numerous GPS units (including my phone) in heavy rain and have never had a problem with tracking accuracy. I understand that accuracy can suffer in adverse weather - but this one was strange.We got about two miles in before we decided to turn around because of worsening weather - it was a straight trail with no turn offs. It was taking a while to get back to the trailhead - moving slow having to get through so much water, so I wanted to double check our position. I pull my Garmin Inreach Explorer+ out of my backpack's mesh shoulder pocket (a common place to stow it while hiking that should not affect accuracy) And see that it shows we have hiked in a circular loop. But that was impossible - we were on a straight trail and came back the way we went in - there were no turn offs to go any other place. So I got to thinking that maybe the GPS hardware on board isn't up to the task. I have tracking points set to 1 second - highest accuracy.

When I look at an activity in the Garmin Connect app (on Android), it nicely scales the graph axis so the changes in elevation is visible, like this: https://i.imgur.com/s66EpDK.jpgHowever, if I have a look at the zoomed in graph (or even just the non-zoomed in version) on the Garmin Connect website on PC, the elevation graph is not scaled at all, and seemingly goes from and to some standard value. This means that I can barely see the elevation change, because my changes are fairly small. It looks like this: https://i.imgur.com/HfPcHNK.jpgFor comparison, it seems like the corresponding graph for heart rate does the correct thing on both the app and website.Am I missing something? And if not, where could I maybe write and add this as a suggestion or as a bug report? Edit: I'm not sure if it matters, but I am using a Forerunner 235 to log my walks.",garmin

Vivosmart HR: a rant,"I've had various vivosmart devices since 2015, occasionally getting a replacement under warranty for different reasons. Recently, I started swimming laps again and was using it to track things like time, (approximate) heart rate, distance (manually added after), and intensity minutes. I had posted a week or two ago about not being able to add the distance anymore and finally caved and contacted Support. It seems an update was done to severely cripple the device. Rather than at least getting some information about my swims, I was told ""since the device isn't designed to track swimming, the update made changes to that part of activity tracking"". It no longer uses the exercise I get towards my intensity minutes. The distance never shows up when I try to add it. What's the point of a ""swim proof"" watch that can't track swimming??? Now I'm worried because I also just got a vivoactive 3 (and was planning to give the vivosmart to my mom but it sounds like it won't be much use to her either), but now I'm worried I made a bad choice picking the VA3!",garmin
Tips for getting Garmin Connect desktop application past 12 months?,I noticed my first year of Garmin ownership is coming up and realized  after 12 months I guess the data is removed?

"Problems with my new VA3, should I return?","I'm getting really frustrated with my new VA3. I have two main problems (so far). First, it's terrible at measuring my hr when biking. I'd say it's correct less than 25% of the time. Usually way under reporting sometimes way over reporting. The other problem I'm seeing is it appears to be way over estimating my active calories. Take for example today. I did about 8000 steps, some of which was heavier work in the garden. Is expect about 300 to 400 for the steps alone, and 100 to 200 for the garden work. Garmin said I did 1200 active calories which is over double what it should be.Measuring your heart rate and estimating calories is some of the basic functionality of a fitness tracker. I paid a lot of money for this thing and if it can't get the basics right I'm not sure why I should keep it. Thoughts?",garmin
Garmin 820 - smart notifications not working,"I really need smart notifications to work when I'm out and about - I do on-call work, and some notifications come through as push messages to my phone.Phone and SMS messages get displayed on the 820 perfectly - wonderful. However, I have not been able to get any smart notifications to work. I have a Vivosmart HR and the notifications do correctly display on there (so smart notifications in theory do work), but I find that the vibrate on the watch is not strong enough to alert me when I'm the middle of a multi-hour ride. I'd love for them to display on the 820 screen as they do for phone/SMS - and all the literature says the 820 does support this functionality...Does anyone have any tips for sorting this out? It doesn't seem to be simply permissions, because it works on the vivosmart.

Replaced VA3,"New VA3 with Silicone Straps and Protector for the BezelSo Garmin replaced my VA3 because of the battery drain.

This is shown through the light green graph above.When plotting, I used this widget to precisely monitor my battery life though I noticed a strange behavior with the battery.Zooming-in to the graph and isolating the green chart, I noticed a quick decline with the battery at first and normalizing afterwards:Battery percentage green, Rate BlueI think it's normal with this rate as long as it delivers to its 6-7 days battery life.I even analyzed it further using a box and whisker chart to determine outlier data in the rate:Box and Whisker Plot Showing Outlier Data, and Linear Plot Showing Rate of DischargeI think, my VA3 is now working properly though will continue to monitor.",garmin

Garmin Connect / MyFitnessPal,"I'm a little confused, and I'm sure this question has been asked before but I've never found a clear answer to it.When you create your profile in MyFitnessPal is asks the following questions:How would you describe your normal daily activities?Sedentary: Spend most of the day sitting (e.g. bank teller, desk job)Lightly Active: Spend a good part of the day on your feet (e.g. teacher, salesperson)Active: Spend a good part of the day doing some physical activity (e.g. food server, postal carrier)Very Active: Spend most of the day doing heavy physical activity (e.g. bike messenger, carpenter)How many times a week do you plan on exercising?___ Workouts / Week___ min. / workoutIt then uses the information you give it regarding your weight, goal weight, age, height, etc. to determine your daily calorie limit. So it has already accounted for your supposed energy output that results from your daily activities, correct? So why then, when you connect your app with a heartrate/gps device like a Garmin, or manually input your daily exercise, does it ADD to your calorie budget for the day?If I go for a ten mile run then Garmin will tell it to boost my calorie budget as much as an extra 2,000 calories that day. Hasn't this activity already been accounted for to some degree when I set my profile to say that I'm an ""active"" or ""very active"" person who plans on working out X minutes day for X times a week? I feel like this burns the candle at both ends a bit and gives me an inaccurate representation of how many calories I need to consume to actually lose weight?",garmin

Consolidating Data with Garmin App,"I just recently got a vivoactive 3, it was back ordered but it is now on the way.  I am currently using a Fitbit Charge HR which is my 3rd and falling apart....again.  So made the leap.  My question is about consolidating all this data into one spot. I am an Android user. I have accounts with the Map My XXX apps, but more recently have been looking at strava. Mainly I hike but just starting to get into mountain biking. Mainly due my running in a gym since it is damn hot.  I also use My Fitness Pal.  So I want to get all these linked plus would be nice to import in any Fitbit data I can.I am curious to know what others are doing to ""collate"" the data.  I am a data kinda guy.  I have thought about Google Fit but I don't think they can get Garmin data. I also have a strong distrust with google. Seems any app I like, they get rid of as soon as I am comfortable with it lol. Looking for opinions on how to view all this.  Also on the Garmin app, can you set up work outs for strength training??  Currently I use an app called WorkIt as it appears easier that trying to enter it into the Fitbit or My Fitness Pal apps.  Thanks.",garmin

Should I upgrade to Fenix 5S from FR235?,Hi. I recently bought a 235 and went for a run. Had some GPS trouble and immediately started too look for a newer model. I came across Fenix 5S which looks very nice. But the price is pretty hefty! Could buy 2 x 235 for the price currently listed. Anyways I can return the 235 today and switch to a Fenix 5S by paying the difference. But is it worth it? Anyone done the same?I do mountain running about 3 times a week. Let me know :),garmin

"Vivoactive 3 newbie here, how to create my own training plans?","Hi, I recently purchased Vivoactive 3 (not the one with music) in order to start moving and lose weight. I've been following 5k plan for running and I want something like this Garmin coach but also for swimming. I've created two workouts for 1500m and 2000m swimming in pools on my PC on Garmin Connect, but when I click send to device it tells there are no compatible devices connected. Since I see that under devices is my Vivoactive 3 connected, does that mean that I can not create training plan for my swimming? Also when I drag and drop one of these workouts to my calendar and I sync it, calendar on my watch doesn't show any of these workouts.

Also one more question, I've been swimming in pool 3 times so far, each time while I was swimming my watch was counting steps which I find very odd, for my last swim of 1500m watch counted for at least 2 or 3 thousand steps, can I disable this somehow to not count steps while I swim?

I was thinking about getting the 645 because it's newer, but the 935 looks very posh, and then the 235 is much cheaper of course.  So it is a very tough decision.I only use heart rate for aerobic base so as long as it is accurate with steady state runs around 130-145 bpm thats really all I care about.  I understand they lag in intervals but that's really fine with me.I don't care about 24x7 monitoring or anything and wear another watch when I'm not exercising, so that doesn't really matter either.Any thoughts?

Running Power Estimator Data Field,"I am a beginner in running and was contemplating buying a stryd footpod to see what the craze surrounding ""running with power"" is all about. Luckily for me, I didn't have to spend another $200 to get a feel of it. I stumbled upon a data field that is meant to do exactly that: estimate your running power in real time.I installed the data field on my Fenix 3 HR. While there are a handful of parameters you can change, I only adjusted the weight field to reflect my current weight. I went for an easy run without bothering about pace or anything, as long as I felt it was in a conversational pace. This is the resulting data set. As you can see, there seems to be a correlation between the power estimated and my running pace and the gradient of the road. I have no idea if my heart rate was taken into account; that's something I would have to investigate later.I wanted to see if the power estimated correlated to perceived effort. I went for a 15 minutes run while trying to hold the power as close to 250W as possible. This is the resulting data set. While this is probably not the best test, as the road was almost perfectly flat, I felt I was putting in the same effort throughout the run. Next time, I would try to run uphill at the same power and see if the perceived effort is the same.So far, this data field seems really promising. I don't really care about absolute values. What matters to me is the consistency in the correlation coefficient between the estimated power and my perceived effort. If this can be achieved, I don't see a reason to salivate over the prospect of one day buying a stryd footpod.",garmin

I'm afraid to go back to Garmin because I don't want to replace it every year and a half.I run and bike regularly and swim occasionally.  I've been looking at the scosche but have heard mixed reviews about the new rhythm 24 (and it might not even work with the fenix 5?) and it seems silly to get the old one.  Has anyone made this pairing with a Fenix 5 and the Rhythm 24?  Is the optical sensor more accurate than the one on the fenix 5?  I like the idea of the arm band over the chest strap but do not find the chest strap that irritating either.What about the Wahoo Kicker?  I know chest straps should be more accurate than the optical ones but is it substantially more accurate than other options. I'm just tired of having wonky zone readings on HIIT runs, insight by those more versed in all of this would be appreciated.Tell me what set-up you are using with you Fenix 5 and HRM and why you do or don't like it.",garmin
Deriving rMSSD From Garmin's / FirstBeat's Stress Level,"Hi all, &#x200B;has anybody been able to reverse engineer rMSSD from Garmin's / FirstBeats Stress Level? &#x200B;I was looking at my morning Stress Level as measured by Garmin and it does show some decent correlation to a scaled version of rMSSD (Marco Altini's Recovery Points in hrv4training, https://www.hrv4training.com/blog/hrv-features-recovery-points-and-more). However, since - as a triathlete - I am interested in my morning/resting HRV, (all day) Stress Level is too much compressed, i.e. I usually wake up with anything between 2 and maybe 10-12 after a hard training day.

[Forerunner 235] Heart rate stuck at 101 during activity,"I went for a short but brisk (for me) 2.5 mile run yesterday. I noticed toward the end of the run my heart rate was 101, much lower than normal, and did not change. A few minutes after my run, it was still 101, so I rebooted the watch, and it seemed to start tracking normally again. I reviewed my run in Connect, and there was definitely a data problem. The HR-based metrics were messed up (calories, training effect, and obviously heart rate), but the GPS and accelerometer based metrics were normal. I went for a 5 mile run today, and the device seemed normal. But has anyone else experienced this kind of issue? Just wondering if its indicative of a fault with the hardware that will get worse over time. If its nothing more than an occasional glitch, I can deal with it.",garmin

[VA3]Garmin connect double counting run calories.,"I've had this problem for a while, I was wondering if there was any way to fix it, or just prevent it from happening.Once in a while, Garmin connect just double counts the run calories by adding the steps calories. Just now, I came back from a run, and there's about 500kcal from it. But Garmin Connect also counted 400kcal for the steps, which sets the active calories to 900! Usually it knows where the steps are from and adjusts the active calories count, but it double counts regularly. I've seen to notice it happens when I pause the activity in the middle, not sure if that's just confirmation bias. Is that a common thing?

Weird Issue Calibrating Run...Mileage wouldn't go lower than 129 Miles on my 645,"So I've had my watch for a few weeks now and love it.  I do a lot of treadmill running and calibrate after every run.  Today I logged a little over 11 miles, which the watch logged as a little under 11.

Garmin Connect needs a REAL redesign (Polar Flow),"Hi you all. I am a Garmin User for many years, owning an Edge for Biking and for about 1.5 years owning a Fenix 5s and now a Forerunner 645. And I love Garmin watches. They are quite precise, the only wrist-worn wearables counting ""only"" about 20-30% more steps than my bra worn Fitbit One. They are intuitive most of the time and really quite comfortable to use and also wear. I have no problems with them most of the time. However the new heart rate sensor, beautiful display and look of the new watch and great battery life brought me to the Polar Vantage V, my first Polar ever. I can say I am not happy with it. Counting 100% more steps (yesterday 27000 instead of 13000), heart rate at the beginning of a workout takes long to adjust, touchscreen issues, not intuitive in my opinion. Lack of ANT+ doesn't help although I knew that before the purchase. Recovery Pro only with a real heartstrap, not even with an accurate arm worn heartstrap, yet alone with only the watch itself.But what I love is Polar Flow. THIS IS INTUITIVE. It's clearly arranged, you can find what you search for within a few seconds. Polar Flow iOS app and web service is really what I want from a sport watch. You can find everything so fast, have a great view on everything. I know Garmin Connect got better within the last year I believe. But it is still horrible in my opinion. Not clearly arranged at all, so many submenus etc. It really is a horrible experience in my opinion. Why can't they get a real redesign, integrating many Polar Flow elements. The app got better I have to admit but the web service is still really, really bad.

Calories Burned is out of control,"Hi guys, I just got Garmin Instinct this week and have been really liking it.  However I am having questions about the accuracy of calories burned throughout the day.  I understand that it's an estimation/ballpark but I think it's really off for me and I want to find out if there is any way to adjust it.  Let me explain a bit about my lifestyle first and what Garmin is telling me.I'm very obese -- 6'2"" and 340 lbs (trying to lose and return to running eventually which is the whole point of this).I'd say I have a lightly active lifestyle.  I walk about 10k steps per day (I had Fitbit before), run around a corporate office building all day, use a standing desk and wobble board for the small time that I am actually at my desk.I don't exercise other than NEAT currently (I'd like to start an elliptical maffetone program, but need to achieve better consistency with diet first).I have an RHR of 71 and by nature of being fat and out of shape, I get winded very easily.I wear my instinct on my left wrist, and am left handed.  As far as I can tell, Garmin doesn't have a feature where you tell it you are wearing on your dominant or nondominant arm.When I used Fitbit, up until I got the instinct, it would generally tell me around 5k calories per day, which is somewhat believable (RMR is around 3100 by formula).Now Garmin is telling me that I am burnin almost 8500 calories per day.  3140 basal and 5330 active yesterday, for example.  I wish, but I am not that active.I am thinking that this may be due to my shitty aerobic fitness combined with heart rate tracking.  In the intensity minutes I am seeing 200-300 minutes per day.  I don't know what 'intensity' means in Garmins terms but I do not think this is right.Is there any way to adjust or calibrate this, or do I just have to ignore calorie tracking?  If so it's ok, I still love the watch (especially liking the weather features) and it's not like I vary my calorie intake based on what the watch says anyway.Thanks and an advice or tips would be appreciated.",garmin

Last time I used it for a 56 km race, the waypoint limit rendered my watch useless for much of the race. The race file had around 200 points, far surpassing the 50 waypoint limit, so my watch stopped recording distance/pace/location after 30% of the race.I've got a 100km race coming up and would love to use GPX to stay on the trail. Can someone advise what workarounds there are for files with more than 50 waypoints? Besides breaking the file into smaller files (a huge hassle to start and restart an activity midrace), is there a way I can use this file for the whole race?Thanks in advance!",garmin

FR645 Optical Heart Rate way off when cycling.,"I always use a chest strap when I work out. When I'm running, the optical heart rate isn't perfect, but it generally tracks what the chest strap says. However, I've been doing some cycling lately and the optical sensor isn't even registering an elevated heart rate.https://preview.redd.it/5nejrz5s5qy11.png?width=1696&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f6c2f087ebb6624fe05503ad4cefed5e158dcf3The picture is an example from last night. I did not start this as an activity on the watch, so it was only doing the normal 24 hour tracking. However, it maxed out at 143 bpm, when my average for that hour was 153. I would have expected the optical sensor to have an easier time on the bike because my wrist isn't moving around. Has anyone else found anything similar?",garmin

Garmin edge 810 having touch screen issues after a rainy day,"Hi, i use my garmin edge 810 for 2-3 years in mostly warm conditions ( above 15 Celcius degrees)  but time to time i ride rainy days so my garmin gets wet. A week ago after i am done with riding screen didn't respond so i switched it off and waited an hour, it was back with normal touch screen. Today, after rainy ride about 2 hours screen did it again and i cannot make it work. Tried to hard reset, now it is stuck at language screen. For a moment touch screen works and i can change language but cannot press next. I think some water get inside ( not sure how it is possible ) and make screen unresponsive? After some tries lcd screen started going off and coming back. I put it in a bowl of rice, hope it helps someway. Did you have similar problems? If so what can you suggest? I am thinking changing touch screen if i cannot recover it but even that option is way too expensive for me. Thanks for your help Update: Garmin offered a replacement at 97 but because i live in Turkey i need to talk with Turkish distributor they gave me a price of 400 for same replacement, Garmin said they can't change Turkish prices because each region has their own.

Looking to upgrade from Forerunner 230. Is Pulse Ox (Fenix 5X Plus) a gimmick for someone who primarily runs?,"Is the Pulse Ox feature on the Fenix 5X Plus something that makes it worth considering as an upgrade from the Forerunner 230 (my current watch)? I exclusively run (up to half marathons, hopefully a full in 2019) and don't know what the best use cases for said feature are.I am admittedly a techie. I know I don't actually NEED Pulse Ox as a feature, but I have a hard time passing up the ""gee whiz!"" factor. At a minimum I am looking to upgrade to a watch with a built-in HRM so I don't have to worry about forgetting my chest strap. Also, access to advanced running ANT+ accessories (specifically the Running Dynamics pod) is also something I'd find value in. Finally, I think a Fenix would blend in at least marginally better with work attire than the obviously-sport-watch 230. The 5X Plus is a bit large for my wrist however. Would it be worth waiting for the next generation Fenix in the hopes Pulse Ox comes to smaller sizes? Is there a watch that would better fit my needs? I'm not concerned about payment or music storage features, though I'm not against them.Mods, let me know if I didn't use the right flair. I wasn't sure which fit best.",garmin

FR 735xt frozen after connecting to phone,So I went to sync my 735xt today (I've been bad with syncing it recently so haven't don't it for a while) and left it to do it's thing. When I get back it's stuck on the startup Garmin logo screen.I have tried holding down the power button until it turns off and it just goes back to the logo screen. I've tried starting it up while holding the lap button to factory reset it and it flashes something briefly and then goes back to the Garmin logo.I logged onto Garmin connect and see that there is a new update available (9.30 -> 9.40) so I'm guessing it tried to update over Bluetooth and managed to mess up the firmware. At no point did I click on anything on the watch confirming a firmware update so I'm pretty annoyed that it managed to brick itself this way.I've had the watch for a while so I'm worried it's now out of warranty. Anyone have any suggestions or will I have to try my luck with Garmin support? The watch wasn't cheap when I first got it so I'd be pretty annoyed if I'm out of warranty and I end up with a useless watch because of a botched software update.Edit: so I ended up getting in contact with Garmin support and after a bit of troubleshooting they agreed it needed to be RMA'd. As it's out of warranty I'd have to pay around 95 to get it replaced. I'm currently deciding whether to go down that route.,garmin

Interval training/track workout question (Forerunner 235) ...Please help!,"I just recently got the Garmin Forerunner 235 and I was super excited that I could make workouts/do interval training with it. However, I'm having trouble getting it to do what I want.I learned how to make the workout on Garmin connect and transferred it to my watch. I started the workout just to see how it'd work (without actually running, just sitting at my desk). My workout was a warmup, 2x 1 mile with an open rest in between each, and a cool down.My hope going into it was that when I pressed the lap button, it would count as 1 mile, no matter how long it took me/what the GPS said. I was hoping that when I saved it to Garmin connect again, i could view my workout and it would say exactly 1.00 mile - 00:37 seconds or something (since I was just playing around and clicking it at random intervals) Instead, it said I ran 0 miles, since it was trying to base it off my GPS. I tried doing the same thing on the run indoor (no GPS setting), but it still said I ran 0 miles.If this is confusing, let me clarify: When I do my track interval training, I just want to be able to click a button when I finish my preset distance and it will record it for me. I find that GPS doesn't work well on the track, and so I don't want it to rely on GPS for my workout. I was hoping that if I made a pre-made workout, that when I would click the lap button on my watch indicating my 1 mile was done, it would say 1.00 mile on Garmin connect, rather than what the GPS tells it.Does anyone know how I can do this/if it is possible? I want to be able to go to my Garmin connect and have perfect rows of 1.00 mile then .50 mile rest, etc. based upon when I clicked the lap button.Thank you!!",garmin

My feature comparison between VA3 and VA3M (some info I did not find elsewhere).,"Alright, so I played with a VA3 for a month before returning it after I heard the rumor that it was being sunsetted (also the barometric sensor was definitely not working, I confirmed this by being at 10000 ft and it said I was at 7K which is quite a significant difference).  I picked up the VA3M for $249 and have been using it for a week or so.Immediate differences:VA3M advantages:VA3M is faster.  I'm guessing there's a CPU difference because the VA3M scrolls much faster and more smoothly than the VA3.VA3M has yet to crash on me yet, guessing the additional storage space (and maybe other hardware changes) improved this.  VA3 would occasionally reset to different watchface (or freeze entirely).VA3M 4GB Storage space: this storage space is shared across all apps/downloads, so you have more space for apps, watch faces, and activities.  This made a pretty big difference because one of the watch faces I use was around 200kb, which is half the storage space for the VA3.VA3M has a gyroscope sensor, this is not in the VA3, this affects directional accuracy when recording with GPS.VA3M has WiFi.  This is primarily used to directly download playlists from Deezer or whatever music service you chose (hopefully Spotify in the future).  It also downloads/updates EPO.BIN to improve GPS.  I'm not sure if the watch updates software over WiFi though.VA3M has been getting updates slightly earlier than the VA3, like the Galileo integrationVA3M has more accurate altitude measurement.  The hole is on the side of the watch vs the backside, at sea level the VA3 and VA3M read roughly the same, altitude changes are also read roughly the same, but the VA3 was unable to figure out my altitude past a certain point.VA3M disadvantages:Have not found bumper protectors for the watch yet, guess they're not in production?  I walk into door jambs a lot :(It is a ""little"" bit bulkier.No steel frame or steel backside!  It looks ""cheaper"" but the material is more scratch resistant.No touchbar from the side, however on the VA3 it didn't work too well for me.Cannot switch direction of the button, I sometimes hyperextend my wrists during stretching which hits the knob on my other watches, haven't yet experienced this with the VA3M but could be a concern.I strongly recommend people get the VA3M over the VA3.  For all of the functions the VA3 does, the VA3M does it better at a similar price point.",garmin

Anyway, I'm reaching out to reddit to see if any of you perhaps know of a source, solution or perhaps another current model watchband that would fit on my epix. I do love the watch, I'm a biologist and spend a lot of time out in the bush and its been a great resource but, I'm a little frustrated with their response.",garmin

Garmin activity interferes with bluetooth connection,"[Fixed! - solution in comments]HiI seem to be having a problem with my watch. I have the Garmin Forerunner 645 Music and when I connect it to my earphones (Jabra Elite Active 65t) everything works fine, but the moment I bring up the activity menu (even without starting the activity), the bluetooth connection with the earphones drops out. Even worse, when I pair the earphones with my phone and play music from there, bringing up the activity menu on the watch drops the connection between the earphones and the phone, even if the watch is not paired with the phone!Has anyone had the same issue and managed to fix it?",garmin

Vivosmart HR+ vs Vivoactive 3?,"Last year I bought my wife a Garmin Vivosmart HR+ to use just as an all around fitness tracker.  This year, her and I both have become pretty avid runners.  She has been using the Vivosmart for GPS run tracking, but it seems like the GPS can take some time to sync up, and of course the display is somewhat limited.Other than the display, is there enough of a difference between the HR+ and the vivoactive 3 run stats/tracking to justify the upgrade?Thanks!",garmin

vivosmart 4 HR during workout,"I am on day one of wearing a Vivosmart 4. HR during the day seemed accurate, and I compared briefly during the afternoon with my Edge 1030/Tickr X HR strap and they were within a few beats of each other for several minutes. HOWEVER, I got on the trainer and did a 1hr cycling workout, the optical on the Vivosmart read in the 90s, low 100s for 5-10 minutes while the Edge/strap had me in the usual 150-160 range. I did swap out straps to a my wife's regular Tickr and even wore both straps at the same time to make sure they matched (they did). The Vivosmart consistently read lower by 20-50 bpm during this workout despite matching up occasionally. I played around with positioning on my wrist and tightness of the strap and it had no significant effect.I didn't start an activity, or do anything to the wristband before doing the workout, should I be triggering an activity or something that may cause the Vivosmart to take more frequent readings or figure out that it's wrong? Is optical hr just inherently going to be inaccurate during workouts? I know straps are more accurate, but I would've expected a BIT more agreement between the readings.",garmin

I've done all the troubleshooting - my software is up-to-date, I tried wetting the sensors on the HRM, I changed the battery on the HRM, and I soft reset my watch. At this point, I'm stumped. Does anyone have any suggestions of anything else I could try?Edit: two calls to Garmin and my HRM is just dunzo. They said most of the time the issue can be resolved by taking the battery out for 10-15, then replacing it. Tried that, nothing still.

Editing sets on vivoactive 3 music,"Hi all,I purchased a Garmin vivo active 3 music 3 weeks ago and have not been able to edit my sets on the watch during a workout.I set up a new strength workout activity, from the Garmin connect website (training>workouts>create a workout) I saved the workout and sent it to my VivoActive 3 music device.To start the workout I go to the Garmin strength app>workouts>select my work out>Do workout and then start the workout by pushing the side button. The workout, works and runs fine throughout. However, sometimes the rep count (amount of times I have lifted the weight) is incorrect. So during the rest stage (after the set) it gives me to option to select edit down the bottom of the screen, however when I tap this button nothing occurs, I have tried holding the button and hitting the button, but nothing happens. If I hold the screen down I am also presented with other options such as edit last set however again when pushing or tapping ect this button nothing occurs. I know that it is not the moisture on my hands or my fingers etc as every other button works in the strength program except edit and edit last set. I have also made sure that the edit weight feature in the settings in turned on. I can edit the reps in the Garmin Connect app once I have finished the workout, however I would like to edit the reps during the workout as there is a button for it and it is a feature that persuaded me to purchase this watch.Any ideas would be much appreciated as Garmin support is beyond a joke. There suggestion was for me to send the watch away to be fixed with a return date of 3-4 weeks after only having the watch for 3 weeks.Thanks!",garmin

Fenix 5 altimeter issue,"Im recovering from a inguinal hernia operation that means I cant run for a couple of weeks so decided to fill the void with some retail therapy and splashed out on a Fenix 5 from amazon. Ive had a couple of Forerunner 235s in the past which apart from having brittle screens have always been very good for tracking my runs so I figured the long battery life of the Fenix 5 would be great for my first ultra (100km) run in 2019.The watch seems great, much more solid feeling than the 235, but the altimeter is just crazy! After a calibration with GPS, with no other changes it will often steadily climb up in to the tens of thousands of meters of altitude. Im running the latest drivers and software (as recommended by Garmin support when I got in contact with them), which appeared to solve the problem temporarily (the altitude didnt appear to change at all for a couple of hours after a calibration) but then soon returned to its ridiculous ascent.To be fair to Garmin after a bit of back and forth trying various factory resets and software versions they have now given me an RMA but they hope to turn around a repair in 10-15 working days and as we head into the holiday season Im not exactly thrilled with the idea of being without a watch Ive only owned for three days until the new year so am in the process of returning it through amazon as defective (theyve dispatched another which should be with me tomorrow).Google has returned quite a lot of threads (including this lengthy one on Garmins own forums https://forums.garmin.com/forum/on-the-trail/wrist-worn/fenix-5-5s/155092-) of people discussing this issue, and quite a lot of angry people complaining about Garminss handling of this. I hope the amazon replacement doesnt exhibit this same issue and I can just carry on enjoying my new watch but was wondering what anyone elses experience of the Fenix 5s altimeter was like?I was sent quite a lengthy explanation of how the altimeter and barometer functions of the watch work and have read a lot of discussion online about the accuracy of this sort of measurement (impacted by the environment etc) so I understand there might be some occasional drift or inaccuracies to expect but what do you guys generally see?Right now the watch o have isnt fit for purpose. Even if it claims to calibrate with GPS at the start of an activity my tests have shown it recording climbs of hundreds of meters in a single one mile walk (on the flat!).",garmin

User Review Instinct and Fenix 5,"I purchased both the Instinct and Fenix 5(just 5 - not X,+, sapphire )with the intent of returning one after a week of use with each one and making a determination as to which one is a better fit for me -I want to reiterate- best fit for me and my use cases and needs and for that the instinct was a better fit.&#x200B;This isnt meant to be as robust as most reviews  many others have done that. I just tried both out and wanted to share my experiences as an average user incase anyone was thinking of one or the other.&#x200B;I wore them to work, on multiple runs, and in the gym. I typically bike as well but didnt during this period. I did trail run though just to get some trees in the way.&#x200B;Aesthetics: I enjoy the gshock look but theres no question the fenix 5 is a better looking device and is more appropriate for a larger variety of environments- looking at you formal stuff. That being said, Im rarely in those formal environments and again, I like the gshock look a lot. Consequently for my every day work and play its a good fit but the fenix is still the better looking watch. The only thing Ill mention not related to looks is the weight - the instinct is lighter and thats great but honestly you dont notice either a whole lot. Both fit comfortably.&#x200B;Durability: obviously the Instinct is sold as the tougher device. I think thats probably true but I wasnt concerned at all about the durability of the fenix 5. Its a pretty tough looking device and I suspect will hold up to much of the same testing the instinct did. However, the screen is definitely a little more vulnerable on the fenix and that was a concern.&#x200B;Usability: the only real difference was in the buttons. Both were great. The instinct takes a little less pressure I think but I really dont think I had a preference either way.&#x200B;Screen: So the fenix has the larger color screen and you can see more data on it. However, while not difficult to read I did find the instinct much easier to read - if that makes sense. Both were readable in sun, indoors, and on cloudy days. However, the fenix proved harder to see in when there wasnt much light outside and required some additional focus. Ultimately I found the instinct screen very readable in all environments. When using activities, they were on par with each other.&#x200B;Customization : So connect IQ is super sweet. I completely agree with most that its sad it wont be available for instinct. I used multiple watch faces and data fields plus a few widgets and apps. All were super cool and gave some great information. However, using those comes with a nominal battery and performance hit. For my use, battery life is very important to me and those cool things were simply not as important to me. I can definitely see why someone else would rather have connect IQ over the extended battery and again, that drain seemed nominal. The performance hit is also very subjective. I hit activities and it seemed longer to open. I have no scientific evidence to support it was actually slower.&#x200B;That being said, the Instinct watch faces and activity data fields are extremely customizable and provide the things I care about most at a glance for every day use and the activities I use. In fact, and I could be wrong so please correct me if so, I couldnt find a way to add the outside temperature to the default fenix faces and you can with instinct. So speaking to just the default watch faces the Instinct provides a bit more data out of the box on one screen. The bubble helps with that (round window in the corner) Getting into bike, hike, strength, and run there were more ways to show that data then I would probably ever need and all the data I care about.&#x200B;Activities: Ill get to gps in a moment but speaking from the activities capability they are pretty much on par (again, my limited use) but I cant help but note that golf is on the fenix 5 and not the Instinct. Im not a golfer, but I have many friends who are and this is definitely a deal breaker for them. Golf aside, and I didnt go down the exhaustive list, but they were pretty equal. Maybe juggling was missing from both? Seriously, ton of stuff which is great. Garmins page doesnt list the fenix 5 as having Ellyptical  but it does and works great.&#x200B;Otherwise they both have courses which is great, plus intervals and training. I used all three of these and love them on both. Fenix has back start and track back and instinct only has track back. The difference is with back to start it will get you back the quickest route and track back takes you back the way you came. I didnt use those yet but my god do I get lost MTB and I know Ill use track back in the future.&#x200B;They both also have 3D elevation options for ascents that I also have not used but sound great.&#x200B;The fenix also provides a ton more data for runners. Most notable VO2 max but also aerobic and anaerobic metrics and performance metrics. This nearly pushes me to the fenix and if you really rely on that data for your training then I would go that way. I run about a race a month - mostly 5ks but I do at least one half a year and a few 10ks and other distances, but I can definitely get buy with the data I get from the instinct. Cadence, HR, etc. I can also see the value in that other data. I just decided there were other things I cared about more - battery and GPS.&#x200B;Battery: Battery and GPS are the two things I expect if anyone does read and want to debate they will. Im just going to say it - after one week I actually found the instinct battery to perform better. I also used the GPS on it more often. This was persistent after uninstalling everything from connect IQ on the fenix. Maybe I had a bad fenix, I dont know, but It does seem like I was getting much different results then whats cited. I seemed to lose almost 20% per day on the fenix compared to about 6% on the instinct. the instinct was also used more. I thought it was the watch faces and widgets so I uninstalled, rebooted, and charged the fenix to 100% and got the same results. Backlight and HRM were at default settings.&#x200B;The Instinct is on day 6 since its last charge and I have three bars. And this is where it could be misleading. Instinct doesnt have a % for battery, just bars. However, theres 5 of them so I just assume each one accounts for roughly 20%.&#x200B;The most notable event was one day I wore both (more later). The fenix was fully charged less then 24 hours prior and used 30 min of gps - the battery dropped to 84%. On the same day, the Instinct had those three bars (60% ish)and hadnt been charged in 5 days. I also had roughly 60 minutes of GPS+GALILEO in that time.&#x200B;I do a lot of camping and activities that keep me from a charger. Battery life is key for me and by all accounts the fenix should have out performed the Instinct here and didnt so this was big for me. I want to point out again - this was with nothing from connect IQ installed.&#x200B;ABC: so I found these both to be a wash meaning they worked the same relative to each other and worked well.&#x200B;GPS: I know this will stir up some stuff for sure. Im going to try and keep it short and sweet. With only GPS on the Instinct I got the wobble youve probably read about. If not, it had me off track a bit - thats the wobble. I was ready to turn it in after that as this is even more important to me then battery. I may not have been sold on the more robust data sets available via fenix but I certainly care about distance and pace; this is big for me as I think it is for everyone. However, I turned on Galileo and it was pretty perfect after. Plus, even with the wobble My distance was mostly as expected - just a little short (.02). The real test was when my wife and I ran a 5k. I wore both (NERD). I had GPS only on the fenix and GPS + GALILEO on the Instinct. Now, I completely understand thats unfair and not apples to apples. I also know I could have used GPS+GLONAS on the fenix and it would have been more apples to apples. So, the rest of this is probably completely unfair and you may rightfully view it as a bad example. That being said - the instinct had me at exactly 3.1 when I was done and my pace was only 5 second off the chip time. The Fenix had me at 3.17 and about 10 seconds off. Not a huge deal, but from what Ive read GALILEO is going to be more accurate then either GPS or GLONAS and based on this one , short, completely unscientific test- I would agree. Galileo is not available on the fenix 5.&#x200B;Now, My wife also had 3.17 on an AW3 cellular so theres that. However, I know the course is 3.1 because we ran it earlier this year for another race and its a reputable timing company. That being said, .07 is not a huge deal I guess - but its still off.&#x200B;Here is where my real issue comes into play....cost.&#x200B;Cost: So as I was evaluating the devices it occurred to me the fenix looked better, and offered a ton more useful data. But (with the sale price) was $160 more with taxes. I had questions about the battery life and GPS accuracy. I had concerns over the screens vulnerability. The features I liked much more about the fenix all came with caveats - Connect IQ is sweet, but there appeared to be a trade off with battery for it. The extra run data is awesome but Im not exactly sure I would use it. The looks are much better, but I also like the way the Instinct looks.&#x200B;In addition I found The Instinct screen to be more readable, liked the Galileo option, and actually really prefer the default watch faces and data fields to the defaults on fenix. I also dont feel like I necessarily need more.&#x200B;Stir that all up and I didnt see the value in paying extra for the Fenix 5. I dont want to try and make the Fenix 5 out to be a bad device either. Hopefully it didnt come off that way - Its entirely possibly my battery issue was either incorrect percentage reading or a bad device. The GPS could very well of had the same results with GLONAS or maybe Im really messed up and it was a bad course. The data is likely very much consumed by others Anyone who golfs would prob only want the fenix Connect IQ is definitely a great resource if you dont mind the extra (potential) battery drain and (potential) performance hit.&#x200B;So there it is, its a short and limited test but since I did it, I wanted to share my results and hope it helps. I would love to hear your results if youve done it and totally expect a lot of arguments against my GPS testing. They are warranted but I still feel confident in my findings.&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;Sort by",garmin
Garmin Fenix 5X vs 5 Plus - Battery &amp; Maps,"Over 2019 I'm going to be running a number of ultra-marathons (varying between 40-60 miles a day), a number of which are going to be self-navigated. Rather than rely on my phone to last the whole event (unlikely with GPS running for the whole time), so I'm considering buying a new watch. I love my Forerunner 235 (which I will likely keep hold of for ""normal"" runs) - thus sticking with Garmin seems like a no-brainer - but I'm a little torn between Garmin's watch offerings that include maps.Right now, I can buy either the Garmin Fenix 5X or the 5(S) Plus for about the same price. I know they all have maps built-in, but I have read some online discussion of issues with the 5(S) Plus's battery life. The 5X seems more reliable in that respects - but would I be getting the same quality of map software in the 5X as provided on the 5 Plus? Or are they the same? Alternatively, is there any word as to whether Garmin has solved the battery issues with the 5 Plus line?I do like the idea of the 5S Plus - but I'm guessing it has a further reduced battery life. The extra features in the Plus line aren't that exciting to me (I'm happy to keep my phone with me for music and contactless payments, especially since the ultras I'll be running require a mobile in their kit list for emergencies). The only thing I'm really not sure about is whether the Sapphire glass on the 5X would make any difference to me - I'm more than happy to buy a screen protector - so I'm guessing not, but any advice would be welcome.",garmin

Garmin VivoSport Slate broken after two months... Don't know what to buy next?,"Hello! I have bought two months ago a Garmin VivoSport Slate after my Garmin VivoActive broke (where the wrist band was connected to the device) and it could not be repaired and since the VivoActive didn't exist. Two days ago, the wrist band of my VivoSport broke down - the gummy-like material snapped. I returned it to the store, but Garmin was not accepting it because ""there have been too many people who were complaining about the broken wrist bands so they don't take it anymore). The store sent it in for reparation, since it was only two months old, so I hope they can make it or anything.I really miss tracking my runs with it, since I just discovered how to run with the heart rate monitor and stuff. I am a long distance runner, training for half a marathon. I don't swim with my device, but I sleep with it. My partner thinks it is because I wore the VivoSport daily and only taking it off for showering and bathing, that the band snapped. Because of my experiences, I am not eager to buy another Garmin. But, I talked to some people and they advice on buying a Apple Watch Nike+ or a Polar V Vantage. The Polar V Vantage is way too expensive - 500 is not what I want to spent since I am a recreational runner. The Apple is nice and my maximum budget, since it is more than just a sportwatch. Also the idea of changing the wristbands to something more classic to go with clothing when going out, appeals to me. But I read a few posts about Garmin Forerunner compared to the Apple and 90% said the Forerunner. &#x200B;What would you do? Cons to the Forerunner: device from Garmin, the wrist band being too fragile / Cons to the Apple: not recommanded by runners.",garmin

Garmin VivoActive 3 Treadmill Activity Problem,"I got my watch last month and like it but have found something annoying. The activity called treadmill always assumes I'm running. Even though the treadmill activity is just ""Treadmill"", when it saves an activity, it saves it with the name ""Treadmill Running"" regardless of the speed you're going. It's easy to change the activity type from ""Treadmill Running"" to ""Walking"" even though there isn't a ""Treadmill Walking"", but it's annoying that the name stays as ""Treadmill Running"" and if you want it to match the new activity type, you have to change it by hitting backspace a bunch to remove the "" Running"" part or clear it and type in a new name.  Is there any way I could get it so the activity name saved is ""Treadmill""? I'd be happy with that even if I'd still have to manually change the activity type. It would be cool if there was a ""Treadmill Walking"" activity type too.  The reason I want this change is so that when I walk on the Treadmill it will show up on the app activities menu under walking instead of running. It would be nice if I can easily change the type to walking without having to edit the name too.  I'd be more happy with just having a Treadmill Walk and Treadmill Run activity similar to how there are separate Walk and Run activities, so that I could calibrate my Treadmill Walk and Treadmill Run speeds without having them be way off. Currently I have it calibrated for running, then have to manually change the distance from the app when I walk because it's usually way off from the actual distance.",garmin

For example, if you had 3000 steps in first half, device crashes, then you take an additional 5000 steps, the 5000 steps don't get added to your previous 3000 steps. You're total for the day just gets updated to 5000, meaning it's off by 3000 steps and their is no way to edit/fix that.  Would that be the same for Intensity Minutes? I find this would be even more annoying than losing steps because I had 60 intensity minutes, it would suck to have my intensity minutes for a whole week be off by an hour.",garmin
Is there a more accurate ski app (Vivoactive 3),"I've been using the default downhill skiing app on my Vivoactive 3.  It gets me the general speed/distance/elevation stats but I don't think it's very accurate.  I noticed in particular on fast groomer runs where I figure I'm going somewhere between 50-60MPH (based on past experiences with other tracking apps on my phone) it shows my top speed as in the mid-40s and the GPS doesn't seem to ""catch up"" to my total descent until I'm back on the lift going uphill.  That also makes the total time for that run inaccurate as it's counting part of that uphill time, which also lowers my average speed quite a bit.  I see several other ski apps out there but wondering if any of them are any better in terms of accuracy?",garmin

How to not count activity towards active Steps (vivo active 3),"I've a Vivo Active 3, when I use it on the elliptical / running / walking / etc - the steps I take are logged under my active step, thus it blows my goal step way off. so one day i'll have 9k steps, then the next I'll have 16k and garmin will then say the following day I should aim for ~ 11k which isn't doable for me unless I go to the gym... &#x200B;Any idea how to tell the garmin to not apply steps during an activity towards the 'active steps' for the day?",garmin
Have you ever dealt with Garmins investigative/claims team? My Garmin 935 is lost between Garmin warehouse and UPS and Im out $500.,"Edit: Update down below!Basically my Garmin had a shipping label created for it, Garmin claims they sent it out but UPS is claiming they never even got a package. There is a tracking number for the package but it just says shipping label created with nothing after that. So basically the package never left the warehouse in UPS eyes and Garmin thinks UPS screwed up and either lost the package or forgot to scan it onto the truck. Basically UPS and GarminThe person I talked to from Garmin on the phone said I probably should get refunded. That wasnt too reassuring lol. That line made me feel a little skeptical so I asked again and they said I would be refunded or the first one replaced but Im weary now. I was told they have to open an investigation/discrepancy case.  It should be a pretty easy process. Does it take a few weeks of them investigating UPS/the warehouse or is it pretty open and shut? I need a Garmin or my money back so I can buy a new one to train with. Currently I have neither. Also to add to the frustration they havent added any kind of ticket to my case or account so the last 6 times Ive called in the last couple of days Ive had to explain my situation all over again hahaUpdate: Theyre sending me a new one at no cost. Thanks Garmin! They were pleasant and very helpful with everything. Theyre going to send a new garmin to us with no cost. They said if the other one shows up just send it back. I have a few guesses on what happened but Im sure theyll figure it out once they investigate. I think they boxed it up, created the shipping label, then went on their New Years Eve break and never got it it sent out. Or its also entirely possible UPS lost it as well.",garmin

Which HRM to go with Fenix 5x/Plus for training - HRM Run vs Wahoo Tickr ?,"Greetings,&#x200B;I am planning to buy a Garmin Fenix 5X or 5X plus, and need to decide which HRM chest strap to get with it. I understand the OHR sensor is the Fenix (or any wrist based OHR for that matter) is good enough for daily activities (resting HR, brisk walking, sleep tracking, etc), but for running and training/cardio it can be found lacking.&#x200B;My primary requirement is being able to see my HR with a fair degree of accuracy (+/- 5-10 is all right), but I want to observe it REAL TIME (or after few seconds of delay if it has to be) on my watch, for my strength training/cardio regimes and runs. I  have just got into training (have a really bad stamina) and still in very early cardio conditioning phase but I am noticing I am getting into an elevated HR stage pretty quickly and often (running out of breath and needing to break out of the activity for moments). So primary requirement is I should be able to observe my HR with good accuracy in real-time so that I can keep my training patterns can be within a defined range, and also observe my conditioning pattern over weeks to see improvements.&#x200B;I have been reading other threads and have narrowed down to the following 2 options - Wahoo Tickr ($50) or Garmin HRM-Run ($99). HRM-Run offers advanced running metrics which is a plus but not really something I need at this point, while the Tickr offers bluetooth connectivity and can come handy when for some reason I dont have my watch on. However the primary requirement is I need to be able to see my HR (bring transmitted by the HRM strap to the watch) almost real-time on watch when I want to. Would I be able to do this with either of these 2 chest straps when paired with a Fenix 5x/plus?

MyFitnessPal sync problems,"Hi friends, my partner recently purchased a Vivoactive 3 music and after wearing it for a month we decided to connect it to her MyFitnessPal account so she could track her calories in/out.

However the changed goal does not seem to have synced with the Garmin app (it is now 10pm the following night) as it is still showing the original goal.I have heard that this can be due to needing to wait for the MFP day flag on their servers, however it has been 24 hours so I would have thought that this would have been applied by now.   The above is frustrating, however it is not the biggest problem. The worst problem is that since syncing the MFP account, her active calories has increased dramatically.

Quality control for Garmin VivoSport,"Hello everyone, I owned a VivoSmart HR for two years, I never really had any problem with it. It's just that I fell ready to get new stuff. I looked at FitBit but, after readings all the comments on the Internet, it looks like FitBit products are highly unreliable. Determining how long will your FitBit last is like rolling a dice, at least that's what I saw on multiples forums. So, I decided to stay with Garmin. I tried the VivoSmart 4 but, the screen was way too small for me and it is an OLED. It's important for me to have a transflective LCD because, it has an always on feature. I bought the Garmin Vivosport, it seem to be the perfect choice for me but I just wanted to make sure, it has good quality control. How strong is the wristband? Will it last for at least two years? It need to be strong because you can't replace it. I have 30 days to return it in case I'm not satisfied, that's the policy of the store.Sadly, it look like Garmin is moving away from Transflective LCD display. They are bringing more and more watches with OLED. I hope they will keep producing a few LCD watches. Otherwise, I'll have to get something like the Amazfit Bip.",garmin

Trying to decide between Vivomove HR and Vivoactive 3,As the title says Im trying to decide between these two models. Never owned a fitness watch before so hoping to get some advice from people who have used them. Looked at Apple watches but quickly decided against those and did some more research and think Ive narrowed it down to these two. It would mostly just be used for basic HR tracking. I play hockey a few times a week but probably wouldnt wear it while playing since I dont trust it not to break so it would mostly just be tracking my weightlifting and cardio in the gym along with regular daily stuff. I work as a landscaper in the summer so it would also be getting dirt and grass on it a lot. Dont really care about judging sleep quality since I feel like Im pretty good at judging that when I wake up. I like the look of the Move a lot better and the fact that its cheaper has me leaning that way. I just want to make sure that Im not really missing out on anything by going with it over the Active 3.If it matters at all I have an iPhone X Id pair it with.

My assumption is that they're the same part, that there's no difference between them. I just got a warranty replacement of my 645, and have a chance to get a Fenix 5x Plus (which - come on Garmin, you have the same size display in that big thing as the 645?) through a work rewards program. Getting it new, I'd prefer the Fenix, though I am ok with the 645, I'm just wondering if I'd see any difference between the display quality. I'd been planning to wait on the Fenix 6 hoping for a couple more things on it, given that my 645 is performing just fine for me - I could use the multisport activity type, but there is a CIQ app for that, which I still need to compare to my 910xt which is still an option.But all that was on the assumption that it was my money, not a reward through work. Still, I have other options.",garmin

Optical heart rate on forerunner 935 vs HRM run chest strap,"This morning was the first day of an experiment I'm going to do over several runs.  Thought the community here might be interested in the data.  It began to dawn on me that this HR spike I usually see towards the end of my runs when not using the chest strap might be false.  For a while, I assumed it was fatigue.  Looking into it, I discovered this app.  It allows you to run the optical HR and strap at the same time while saving both into the fit export.https://imgur.com/a/9NiYkCZDuring this run, the goal was to stay under 148 bpm.  Green is the difference between the two HR readings.  On the bottom, orange is times when I falsely would have believed I needed to slow down.  Light blue is times when I wrongly would have believed I could speed up.Today I wore the watch as I usually do.  Now that I have this, I will toy with band tightness and wrist position to try minimizing these differences.2nd run.3rd run.",garmin
Vivoactive 3 Music Playlist That Can't be Deleted - Need to Factory Reset?,"I've got a playlist that can't be deleted in Garmin Express, or in Windows File Manager.  This happened to me a month ago, and I reloaded the album (with playlist) and deleted it again, and the playlist was gone.  Doing so now just leaves the rogue playlist that no longer has any associated MP3 files.So, if the only way to get rid of that playlist is to do a Factory Reset, will I lose all of the history I have on the Garmin Connect site?  I know that the watch will be wiped - that's not a problem as reconfiguring will not be extensive.  But, I don't know if the data in my Garmin account persists when the phone is reset to factory defaults.If anyone knows what to do with a rogue playlist, or has an answer to the data persistence when resetting the watch, please let me know.Thanks!-bk",garmin

"Optical heart rate on forerunner 935 vs HRM run chest strap, 2nd run","Original post.Today I tried wearing the Forerunner higher up on my wrist; about four finger-widths up from my wristbone.  To keep it from sliding down, it was also slightly tighter than what was comfortable.  I don't know if the improvements are due to positioning, tightness or both.  I'll have to try wearing it in the standard watch position, but tight next time to see.Today's chart:  https://imgur.com/a/B5iJP1QComparing the two runs differences:  https://imgur.com/a/eXkTdoRThere were a few more possibly contributing differences between the runs.  It was a little warmer and there was more wind.  With the extra heat (still cool, though), I didn't wear my hoodie.  I didn't sweat much, stayed pretty dry.Results:I can't believe how much better the OHR did today.  Completely happy with the tracking.  The average absolute variance on my first run (thanks, /u/LukeWarmCage) was 7 bpm.  Today was only 2 bpm.  Wearing the OHR higher and tighter increased its accuracy by 71%!EDIT:  Should also note that I ran the same route.3rd run.",garmin

Help me choose! Fenix 5 vs Fenix 5s vs 735XT,"Hey all, thanks for any advice you can give me.&#x200B;I run about three times a week. Not for too long a distance however I plan to change that and get more into running as a consistent exercise and eventually to do a marathon.&#x200B;Recently I had been using a Vivoactive 3, however it had an issue with recording elevation and it had to be returned this week. I had only really started getting into Garmin IQ, and recently discovered that some watches can give me some useful insights. So my options are ideally what is in the title: Fenix 5 for 319.00, Fenix 5S for 319.00 or the Forerunner 735XT for 230.00 (935 is an option and likely more comparable, however I want to get your insight on what I may be missing).&#x200B;I should note that I get 12% discount on top of these due to the retailer I work for, so tie that into the equation. I don't really want to exceed much farther than 300 in budget. I guess my main concern is whether or not weight and size is a concern to many (I'm a slim, 6""2' build with skinny wrists) and whether or not I would be missing out on much of value from any of the above models.&#x200B;Edit 1: I've seen the 645/645M offerings however the company I work for doesn't sell these, so it doesn't really meet the same prices there about as the Fenix range mentioned above. Also I'm not that fussed about music as I run through a city half the time and need to listen out for people and vehicles.&#x200B;Edit 2:  Bought the Fenix 5. Thanks too everyone who gave me advice! While it is slightly heavy, I'm sure I'll get used to it. I'm still getting used to using buttons as opposed to the touchscreen on the VA3. So far I love it.",garmin

It seems to count the lengths (turns) perfectly, giving great feedback on splits and number of strokes. Very useful! Yesterday, I did an interval workout. One was 10x100yd on 2min (pretty slow, I know-- don't judge). I pressed the button at the start and stop of each 100. Now I see that several of the turns were not detected.

Should I buy a brand new Forerunner 35 or a used Vivoactive(no HR)?,"Im getting into running with a goal of finishing a my first full marathon in October. Looking for a watch to track my runs (both outdoor and indoor runs). My colleague lent me his 4yo Garmin Vivoactive (no HR) so I could try it out. Ive been pretty happy with it.

The new Forerunner 35 retails for $200CAD while a new Vivoactive retails for $350CAD. What do you think is a fair price for the used Vivoactive from my colleague?

Note to enabling Galileo on new old Garmin devices,"My first Fenix 5 was just replaced due to a button issue. When I updated it via BT to 12.3 the update did not update the GPS.

I think with this new F5 I will just use it for a few days and then check Garmin Express for an update. If no update is offered after a few days I will try the Restore to New option and update with Garmin Express like I did the first one.If anyone knows a better option I am all ears.I am posting this as I have seen people saying that they do not see Galileo option even after updating to 12.3 on the Fenix 5.

Difference between training status and productivity,I have a 5S and was wondering whats the difference between training load and training status.

Calorie counting for vivoactive3,Let me start by saying I'm a novice when it comes to fitness trackers so sorry in advance for my ignorance! I've been looking into getting the Va3 (non music) and am interested into counting calories burned throughout the day. I do a lot of strength training/general workouts in the gym. I've heard the Va3 (and a lot of trackers in general) are a bit hit and miss in recording exercises. I tend to keep a handwritten log of my workouts anyway so this isn't an issue. My main concern is whether I could track calories burned without having to indicate what exercises I'm doing as I don't fancy fiddling around with it in-between every set. Any advice would be greatly appreciated! :),garmin

Fenix 5x Cycling VO2 Max vs Running VO2 Max,"I haven't been able to run in several weeks due to PF, so I took up cycling a little more seriously to keep my fitness.

What I'd like to do next, since i finally found my HRM strap, is the LTHR test but I believe that relies on accurate VO2 Max numbers.Anyone experience anything like this?

Is the Garmin Vivoactive 3 a good M600 replacement?,"So basically, my current watch is the Polar M600, which is powered by Android wear. I returned it tho and about to order a Garmin Vivoactive 3. I returned the M600 because as a concept it's great, wear OS features with advanced fitness and exercise tracking, but it's executed quite poorly imho. Battery life is horrible, not even 1.5 days even with Android (polar claims 2 days with Android) and my required minimum is 2-3 days, it doesn't have real sleep tracking that a free android app running on a phone can't do, it doesn't have a barometric altimeter, it doesn't have 24/7 hr tracking, it doesn't have vo2max estimation, and you can't get a band that isn't cheap feeling silicon so this isn't something you'd want to wear to a business meeting. If it were priced cheap, like 100-140 dollars maybe that would've been understandable, but at its current price that's a joke. I looked online and it seems the Vivoactive 3 has the above features covered. I frankly don't care about onboard music storage, cause I have LDAC on my phone, and my headphones support it so listening to music running on a watch would likely result in a downgraded experience. I've heard that OHR monitors aren't that accurate for rigorous exercise but I have the polar H10 strap and I think it can be connected to the Vivoactive for more accurate readings?What do you guys think?",garmin

Can anyone tell me why Vivoactive 3 randomly lights up or vibrates?,"Hi.My VA3 is only a week old and I'm still getting used to it, but there are a couple of things that I can't figure out.Firstly, the backlight comes on randomly for a few seconds and then goes off every 1-5 minutes. I've already changed the 'Gesture' setting to 'Only during activity' and that seems to work (i.e. it comes on when I'm in an activity and raise my arm, but it doesn't come on when I raise my arm while not doing an activity). But despite this setting the light just comes on when it feels like it when I'mnot doing an activity.Secondly, the same kind of thing is happening with the vibrate - it will buzz for a full second and then stop, only to buzz again randomly 1-5 minutes later. This one especially is preventing me from wearing the watch daily as the frequent buzzing gets annoying very quickly. It happens all day long, whether I'm doing an activity or not.With both types of behaviour there are no messages on the screen or any hint of what it's trying to tell me. The battery is over 90% and they still happen whether I'm sitting perfectly still or moving around. They are not related either - it will buzz OR light up, but never at the same time. Also there is no pattern, sometimes it won't happen for 10 minutes and sometimes it will go 3 times per minute. I have been through every menu & setting I can find and even temporarily disabled every feature (bluetooth, workout detection etc) but it still happens. There just seems to be no explanation for either of the things.Can anyone tell me why these things might be happening and how I can stop them?

"Sorry for doubting you, Garmin!","So, in addition to my previous posts I ran some comparisons over my workout stats from different devices and also tried the Suunto 3 Fitness. And I have to reevaluate my approach. The main reason I decided to try the Suunto 3 was that I really liked the all black design. But not even after 24 hours the watch went where it came from. I can't say a bad word about it, it's an excellent good looking, lightweight and comfortable watch that does a decent job with workout tracking via OHR, but the downside is the Suunto app - for what the watch can do, there's only a few possibilities to dig data from the app, and that's a shame, not at all comparable with Connect. Also Garmin offers way more customization for the watch faces, in case you'd prefer to see your calories instead of steps. But what's important is the workout tracking. I wore both during my training session this morning and ended up with almost identical calories (460 on the Garmin, 469 on the Suunto). I just had to try... :)So I have to admit I was wrong, the calorie tracking is okay, or at least matches other devices (including AW3), yes it varies in time and over devices, but I guess generally I was overestimating my burn based on my previous experience. Blame me, I'm sorry and will love and appreciate my Garmins from now on. :) (Still don't like wearing the chest strap though, but it just works better...)So now my biggest problem is what band color I want to buy in addition to the Red/Pink one I originally have on my F645M. :DPS: If anyone of you has a tip for third party watch face, that: doesn't drain battery, shows digital time, date, battery life and calories and looks good, please let me know.",garmin

Spotify test with VA3m,"I can report that I've installed the Spotify app on my VA3m, downloaded two playlists, and now I'm listening to it at my desk.

(I got lots of skips while running on a previous test.)&#x200B;You have to find your music through the interface on the watch, which I think is weird; I expected that I would be choosing the music via my phone. It appears that to get music you must 1) be in a viable WiFi zone to which the watch has been connected and 2) be in range of your phone with Bluetooth turned on and the GarminConnect app running (someone should verify this, I got an error at one point). Then, you go to the watch app and choose a playlists to download. It downloads it directly over WiFi, not via the phone (someone should verify this as well). I chose a couple of playlists that were suggested by the app called ""Fun Run ..."" and such.   When I first selected a playlist, the watch told me that 23% battery was not enough to download and instructed me to plug the watch into a charger near the router. Downloading a playlist with 60 tracks takes a good while (15 min?), so I think this was good advice. But, once a playlist is on your watch, it plays back without need of your phone at all.",garmin
VA3M/Spotify/Wifi Issue,"I don't think this problem is particularly related to the newly released Spotify for VA3M.

If I keep trying, however, it will eventually get the connection and the downloading will begin and complete as expected.  I seem to recall the same issue with the Deezer app (which I've already uninstalled) so I don't think it's a Spotify issue.The watch is plugged in and within a few feet of the access point.Has anybody else had this issue?  The only network configuration issue I can think of is SSID for the access point is hidden. I may set it to broadcast and try again to see if that's the culprit.UPDATE: It is, indeed, the hidden SSID that causes the trouble. It connects almost instantly to a visible SSID.

Apple Health Data for Walking + Running Distance is wrong,"I have the 'connect' ios application set up as a 'source' in apple healthkit.

Fixed a Fenix 3hr syncing issue,"Hello fellow Garminites (is that a thing?),&#x200B;TL:DR - If your watch isn't syncing, connect it to a computer and see if there is an activity file that isn't uploading to Connect (manually import it).  It could be blocking the rest of the activities.&#x200B;I wanted to share a syncing issue I had fixed, I thought maybe it might help someone in the future.  It was driving me nuts and I couldn't find a solution online between here and the Garmin forums.  &#x200B;Since 2/14 my Fenix 3 HR had not been syncing my activities or logging my all day tracking (steps/hr/floors/etc).  It was connected as I could see the current all day tracking and was receiving notifications on my watch.  However, at the end of the day, all that info was not found on the phone app.  It just disappeared.  I tried numerous things that I found through my searching (power cycle the phone/watch, disconnect the watch from the app, manually trigger a sync from the watch).&#x200B;One suggested was to manually upload an activity via pc (by USB).  Whenever I connected to my PC, Garmin Express would automatically upload all my activities from the past week.  However, when I went into the watch storage via File Explorer and looked at the activities, I noticed there was one from 2/15 that wasn't uploading.  I tried manually uploading it on the Connect site a few times and it kept failing.  So I deleted the file.  I disconnected my watch from the PC and ran a sync from the phone.  Success!  Then I started and saved a new run activity to test it.  The activity saved and sync'd to Connect.  Seems the issue was resolved.&#x200B;Something must have happened with that activity that was being tracked.  Maybe my watch died during the activity and it didn't resolve itself when I charged it back up.  I don't recall the circumstances.&#x200B;Watch Firmware: 4.90Connect App version (Galaxy Note 8):  4.15.1&#x200B;",garmin

Can Garmin Instinct control spotify? And two other questions,"Hi all, Just some quick questions. I have looked at plenty of reviews and online sources, but cant find the answer.I am trying to decide between the vivoactive 3 and the Garmin instinct. Overall, the instinct is more appealing to me because of the option to use courses (and more navigation options) the battery life and the durability of the watch. However, one thing that I cant seem to find out is whether the watch can control Spotify. I know music control is a listed feature, but I cant find out whether this would work with the Spotify app on an iPhone (8). I usually have my phone with me while running, so I dont really need a stand-alone app on the watch. However, not being able to control it would be kind of a dealbreaker for me.Second question: I am not an advanced runner, so I do not know whether the lack of VO2max data would be a dealbreaker in the long-run. Any thoughts on that would also be appreciated.Third question: on the Vivoactive there seems to be stress tracking (and HRV like capabilities), is this also possible on the Instinct?Finally, as far as I know, the instinct doesnt support Control IQ, but I did read something about Garmin Connect. Is this a rebranding of Control IQ? Or are these different services?Thanks in advance for your help!",garmin

Thinking of Buying VA3 Music,Ive owned a Fitbit charge 2 for about 2 years. Ive really started working out again. Ive lost about 14 lbs tracking calories and working out in the last couple of months. I went out and bought a Versa today and I honestly did not like the feel at all. Its nice looking but the devices functions are not what Im looking for. It lags and I hate that it has a stock images of people working out when searching for an activity to choose. Honestly that killed it for me lol! Im going to return it and possibly go with the VA3 music. I prefer the all Black. How good is Garmin at tracking daily activity at work? I do hvac and climb extension ladders and walk on roof tops all day. Calorie tracking has been my only way to lose weight. I would like to keep my deficits as accurate as possible. Fitbit has been pretty good at this. I also run on the weekends about 10 miles over the 2 days. What exactly does the GPS do? I plan on hiking a lot more in the future and also looking for new running trails. Thanks in advance. Sorry for the chopped up paragraph. Ive been doing research for the past 2 hours lol! Edit: I actually went to bestbuy on my lunch break and purchased the VA3 music. I was kind of bummed at the backlight indoors. But when I went outside it looks great. I love the look of it. MyFitnessPal kind of sucks. Its really slow for me. I might just use another food tracker and do all the math my self at the end of the week. Other than that everything looks good so far.

Garmin Connect Calories,"Hey everyone I just bought a VA3 Music. Im coming from Fitbit so Im still in the process of adjusting to everything. So far I like the watch itself!

After much thrashing around, I finally realized it was the APAC version.  Had it been a ""sold by <vendor name> and delivered by Amazon.com"" or ""sold by and delivered by <vendor name>"" I would not have been that surprised. Since it was Amazon, it never occurred to me that it might not be the ROW version.The description of the product doesn't designate APAC or ROW nor can I find a product number.  The comments, however, are full of folks complaining about the same issue.  I never looked at the comments since I wasn't looking for any information about the actual product.Amazon offered a return with full refund, 25% refund if I wanted to keep the APAC version, or directed me to Garmin for a ""warranty exchange"" (which made no sense at all).  When I asked if I could get a full refund and then purchase a ROW version from Amazon, the rep said ""of course"" and then sent me a link to the exact page I had used to purchase the APAC version.  No thanks.Getting the full refund and buying it from a local shop.",garmin

FR935 stopping recording,"Just wondering if anyone else has encountered this. On a pretty consistent basis lately, and only on races / group runs like Parkrun, my 935 just stops for no real reason as if I never started the run activity. It generally happens within the first km, I notice when I look down to check if Im close to the first split. Last week it was during a 21K trail race, today at Parkrun and has happened at about 3 or 4 Parkruns previously. Once I remember it recording for the first 3K of a Parkrun before pausing, at least that time it was only a pause rather than completely going back to the normal watch / home screen. Ive been thinking I mustve not pressed the start button properly so today I checked and the activity definitely started, I didnt check again till the 1km mark and no activity any more. I run 6 x per week and it never happens on solo runs, even on warmups before a race or Parkrun or rides to & from. No complaints with the watch aside from this. Im not doing anything different to any other run but it just seems to be when Im in a pack with other people (say about 200 or so other watches being started at the same time). Has anyone else had something like this happen? Some kind of interference from other devices? Ive got an Ultra coming up in a couple weeks so Id like the watch to record it properly! Any ideas?

Garmin vs Suunto cal burn,"Hey guys! Ive recently upgraded to a fenix 5 from a suunto Ambit 3 and I love it! There is one metric that is really confusing me however and this is the cals burnt. I understand that different manufacturers will have different algorithms to how they work out cals burnt but Ive found that the difference between the garmin and the suunto to be crazy! For example. Yesterday I did a 27.5km fell run with 2000m of ascent in about 4 hours and according to my garmin I burnt 1950 cals. A few weeks ago I did a 29km fell run with 1500m of ascent in about 4 hours and according to the suunto I burnt 4000 cals. I would have expected the longer run to be more cals however, not twice the amount! All my metrics are the same for each watch. Is my fenix 5 set up wrong or has my Ambit 3 just been wildly overestimating cals?

Why pay extra for the 645 over the Vivoactive 3 - help please!,"Over the last couple of days, I spent hours reading reviews and watching YouTube videos about Garmin watches. And with the help of Redditers, I also determined that the 'new' 20mm qr straps of the Vivoactive 3 and the 645 are actually quite solid.That leaves me with the 245, Vivoactive 3 and the 645. So I decided that I probably cannot wait for a 245, which leaves me with the latter 2.Looking at the devices, I see one main point of difference: touchscreen vs buttons. It seems to me that otherwise the screen quality is identical (rather poor, but ok). For me, instore the touchscreen felt quite decent and intuitive. But I am affraid it will be less comfortable when running. What is everybody's feeling about that?Music is something I don't really care about.The other main driver is the price: I can pick up the VA3 for around 200 euro. The best deal I found with the 645 is 389 euro including a running dynamics pod, bike mount, extra leather strap, international charger and a carrier case.So what is your view on this: is the 645 really worth the extra money?",garmin
Why I bought the instinct,"This post is directed towards a very specific crowd of interested but overly analytic (and often indecisively paralyzed) folk looking for their next (or first) smart watch. For me it was all about price and aesthetic fit - and I hope this post can help you finally bite the bullet. A, cost-to-features and daily wearability benefits from a more than average fitness guy perspective, kind of post.I recently picked up the Instinct after a few weeks of tremendous research and youtube video surfing. For those of you still on the fence, you've probably heard about DC Rainmaker but if not, you need to check him out: https://www.dcrainmaker.com/ His reviews were amazing and his very detailed cross-comparison tables were a life saver. This post isn't necessarily a break down of the technical aspects of what Garmin provides. If you're a heavy fitness addict, chances are you already know what you need. If you're a casual adventurer who wants helpful tools on demand in a watch that can last more than 24hrs while still having smart features, this post is for you.Coming from a Suunto Core, I was looking to upgrade to a watch that could relay smart notifications while also providing the updated tech for activities like hiking, general trail wandering, and other random activity tracking (SUP, sailing, etc.). Initially, the Instinct attracted me because of its price tag and its similar, rugged all-black look of my old Core. While a lot of people compare its styling to the old G-Shocks (I see it a little bit), this watch looks way better imho (nothing against you nostalgic people). But I was still worried about general wearability (i.e. a rugged fitness watch at a work event, etc.) Which lead me to thinking about paying a bit more for aesthetics..So then I went down the rabbit-hole of price. If I was willing to spend $300, I might as well check out the 645 for only $100 more. And why not an extra $50 for the music version. But if I'm already at $450, I might as well look at the Fenix 5 for $500. And if I'm looking at a 2+year old watch (which is what also negated the older 935 and 735xt), I might as well look at the 5+ which gives me Garmin Pay, Topo maps, and music storage (and a whole lot more). All of a sudden I'm at $650+, after following the logical train that I don't necessarily mind spending the money if what I'm buying is going to make me happy and last me for at least the next 3+ years.If you live near a FleetFeet or REI (I'm sure other stores allow you to try them on), you should spend a quick trip and go. I found that my quandary was immediately reduced between the 5+ and Instinct based on how the watch sat on my wrist alone. The 645 was too small and the 5S+ was small but oddly unproportionate with its thickness on my type of wrist (YMMV, obviously.) The Instinct ended up walking out of the store with me because at $300 I figured I could save the difference in money from the 5+ and buy a Fossil or TicWatch if I ever wanted a simple, more dressy smart watch for other occasions and still pay less while still getting all the function I could even need with the Garmin. This also gave me way less FOMO over ConnectIQ. And, if any of you are REI members, you'll get at least $30 back in dividends- essentially 10% off.If this story resonates with any of you casuals out there, I hope it helps ease you decision. In addition to DC Rainmaker, here's a compilation of the most helpful posts for me when deciding which watch to buy:https://www.reddit.com/r/pebble/comments/9of04s/garmin_instinct_review_comparisons_to_pebble_2/?ref=share&ref_source=linkhttps://old.reddit.com/r/Garmin/comments/axdout/instinct_to_get_or_not_to_get/?ref=share&ref_source=linkhttps://old.reddit.com/r/Garmin/comments/av41or/fenix_5s_plus_vs_forerunner_645_for_runninghiking/?ref=share&ref_source=linkhttps://youtu.be/FwKqbbdNuiEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CrMaaX3BzATL;DR: At $300, the Instinct gave me awesome battery life, simple smart-watch features (notifications and music controls), and just the right amount of function for my preferred activities (hiking, SUP, etc.) GO TRY ON THE WATCH FIRST - It really does help. I still have $100-250 difference in saved money that I can spend on a daily, true smart watch if I want. I'm happy without ConnectIQ. And, thank you /r/Garmin for the advice and comments (and of course, DCRainmaker).",garmin

FItness tracker or watch for running that can also work in the gym,"There is so much information out there it's hard to parse which tracker is best for what.&#x200B;I'm getting a bit more serious about fitness and am looking beyond Fitbit trackers. Specifically, I'm getting into more running, but I also have hips that give me trouble sometimes so I want something that can accurately track my efforts in efforts in the gym.Must:Be able to sync HR data to strava. My Fitbit can't do that, and I love the strava app.  I can't get the most out of it unless both GPS and HR data can be synced to itA HR monitor good enough to track runningCan sync GPS with my phoneNice to have:Replaceable bandIf the built-in HR sensor is kind of lame, the ability to sync with an external chest heart-rate monitorInternal GPS. I don't mind carrying my phone with me on a run at all, though.Not a complete waste of time at the gym. It doesn't necessarily need to count reps for me, and doesn't need to give me a perfectly accurate HR the whole time, but it would be great if it didn't tell me my HR was 80 during an entire workout...&#x200B;I'm strongly considering the Vivosmart hr+, but that doesn't allow syncing with external sensors and as far as I can tell is kind of lame for weight lifting. I'm also considering the Forerunner 235, but I don't need all the bells and whistles like Garmin pay&#x200B;EDIT:Thanks for the comments, all. I ended up purchasing the vivoactive 3 and I like it so far. &#x200B;I did one weight training session with it. The heart rate monitor didn't really work for this at all, but it still recorded the activity and did a suprisingly/delightfully good job of tracking reps and the type of exercise.&#x200B;I've done one run with it and it was great. The heart rate tracking was solid. The only downside I see is that the UI on the watch and in the Garmin Connect app isn't the most intuitive, but I'll figure it out with time.&#x200B;I'm happy with the purchase. Thanks for all of your suggestions!&#x200B;",garmin
Vivoactive 3 Music display is pretty dull..?,I just opened my new vivoactive 3 music and I'm noticing the display is pretty pale and very blue tinted. Videos online of people using the watch made its display seem much brighter and more vibrant. Is there a vivid setting or something I can adjust or is this how it is?

Which Garmin for a Polar A300 user?,"I have always had a Polar HRM- but I think its time to switch to Garmin. I use a A300 and a M450 bike computer. And love the A300 because it shows heart rate in water - which no new watch does.   Want 24/7 heart rate accuracy and the usual stuff. I dont care how smart it is and I dont need pay or music. I bike, swim both in a pool and open water, kayak, backpack, and hike.  I walk a lot, but dont run.  I need good battery life for multi day rail trail bike/camp adventures. Im thinking Instinct.

Issue with swim workouts,"I have been having an issue where whenever I am doing a swim workout, the distance doesn't seem to be calculating correctly. I have tried yards as well as meters, but the end result is the same. Example, if I am swimming 200 meters (during a planned workout), the watch will go off consistently after I finish my glide on the last length. I originally thought this might have been due to me incorrectly assuming the pool was in meters, but it possibly being in yards, so I changed my metrics for my planned workouts, synced them to my phone, and tried again the next day. Using yards, the behavior was the same. The watch would go off right after the glide on the last length. This occurs on pretty much any length I swim, 25s, 50s, 100s, and 200s so far.During my workouts the watch will go off, the distance goes back to 0 mid lap, and when I get to the wall I have to press stop followed by start and then it shows the correct yardage (meterage?) and then press the lap button to get my rest set to start.Has anyone else run into anything like this? I have already done a bit of research on possible swimming issues with these watches (i am using the FR935; indoor swimming) and can say I am using a single stroke, not stopping mid lap, pushing off hard every lap (not flip turning).

935 (tri bundle) vs. 5s plus (sapphire),"Struggling with this decision...  -Will be an everyday wear watch.  Office work with some occasional laying on the ground/concrete to write estimates.  (Scratched my last watch doing this... Ugh).-Lots of lifting weights, CrossFit, and running.   935 Tri bundle wins here for lighter weight and heart rate strap included.-I've owned the 935 before for a few months and sold for an Apple Watch series 4 in a moment of (stupid) weakness... but I definitely remember how awesome the 935 was.-But I worry about the 935 for everyday wear getting banged up, and I like the looks slightly better of the Fenix 5s plus.. and it's newer and I've never owned one... I don't ""need"" maps or music, but I do think maps is a neat feature that I'd like to play around with..-But the 5s Plus will cost more (~675 vs. ~550), has worse battery life (which would mainly be an issue for sleep tracking for me), and is a little bulkier (thicker, 16g heavier), so not quite as good for running/fitness and also for tracking sleep (which I did utilize with the 935).-SAPPHIRE glass is Very appealing for me.  I like to keep my watches somewhat nice, and have not liked screen protectors in the past.  The Fenix 5s Plus seems like a more durable bezel/case than the 935, but I'm not certain as I've never seen a 5s plus in person.-Lastly, I'm 5'7"", male, 155 lbs., thin build.  I owned a regular Fenix 5 and it looked like a Tank on me.  I did not enjoying running with that massive beast.  I also got quite a few ""your watch is HUGE"" comments.  Lol.   It had a silver bezel that I think really made it stand out as being large.  I'm looking at the all black 5s plus.  I really think it would fit me well.  (No dealers have it locally to try, unfortunately).TLDR:-Basically, I think I SHOULD buy the 935 tri bundle (makes more sense when you add everything up.. price, battery life, thinner lighter profile, etc.), but I WANT to buy the Fenix 5s plus sapphire (better for everyday wear, looks awesome, sapphire is appealing, slight newer tech/more features).  =]-Both look like incredible watches.

How long are Garmin watches typically supported?,"Calling all veteran garmin users... &#x200B;I have been running since like 2015 and in OCT 2017 upgraded to a Tomtom Spark 3 a month before it was discontinued (lol), the watch is now down to a +-24 hr battery life with 24/7 activity tracking and a 30-60 min run.

I am hesitant to purchase it now though, as I don't want to be in the same position with Garmin stopping support for the 935 soon after I purchase it like I was with the Spark 3. With Forerunner 945 on the horizon the fears are a tad compounded. &#x200B;I can afford an extra couple of grand or so [South African here] on the newer watch if that will be a better investment in the long term. 6 months of bug fixes doesn't deter me.

vivoactive 3 Music with Jaybird X4's,"Yesterday was my first run with my vivoactive 3 Music and new Jaybird X4's.  While walking to the start of the run, the drop-outs were unbearable.  Once I started running, it got a little better (presumably because the watch was a bit closer to the pods and not blocked by my body) but still not great.  Eventually, I swapped the watch to my right wrist since the controller for Jaybirds was on the right.  That seemed to help a bit more.  Oddly, after about 10 minutes, I didn't seem to notice any more drop-outs (which makes no sense whatsoever).Since I normally wear my watch on the left wrist, I re-configured the Jaybirds to put the controller on the left as well (even though I have no idea if any of the Bluetooth hardware is actually in that part of the device).  We'll see...Even though it's primarily about the FR645M, I stumbled onto this page.

Why does garmin have such a hardon for zone 3?,"I'm working on base building right now, tracking my runs with a fenix 5X and an HRM strap. Almost all of my weekly distance is in zone 1 or zone 2. Garmin hates it. It drops my VO2 max every time I go for a long run and then shows me as unproductive for the entire week until my weekly tempo run in zone 3. Then it says I'm doing great... until my next long run.It also shows long runs as ""unproductive"" or ""maintaining"" and tempo runs as ""improving"" or better. It doesn't seem to distinguish between a 1 hour run and a 15 minute run at the same pace. But due to cardiac drift, it shows ""performance condition"" as steadily dropping until it's almost always at -5 or lower by the end of my long runs.My performance has improved dramatically in the last two months since I bought this watch. But I've only been in ""productive"" status for a few days, total.What gives? Is garmin connect optimized for extremely fit people? Or extremely unfit people? Am I an outlier somehow?",garmin

VivoActive 3 inacurate distance measurement,"I started working out at the beginning of september and halfway through september I got a VivoActive 3 to track my daily steps and heartrate and sleep mood etc. But I also use it for when I go for a run.I'm a beginner runner and using the Couch to 5k app by active on my OnePlus6. And the distance travelled at the end of the run was always different between the app and what my vivoactive have measured.For example, my monday run: my garmin said I ran 5.07km, where as the app said I ran 5.35km. My run yesterday was 5.17km on my Garmin but 5.50km in the app. This is inline with earlier runs where the bigger the distance ran, the bigger the difference.So I checked google maps and mapmyrun for the ""actual"" distance and this was closer in line with the app then with the Garmin. In fact, it was a bit farther then the app measured, but that could have been that i cut some corners.A 280m and a 330m difference on a roughly 5k run seems a lot to me.

The main reason I started looking for a new watch (had AW3 previously) was that I randomly saw a Fenix 5s plus and was insantly wowed! It made me do a little research and found out I could get way more stats and data than my AW is giving me. I loved the Fenix 5s+, not so much the price. So I came over F645M that does everything I need for half the price of Fenix. Also I have very tiny wrist and the Fenix is pretty bulky and heavy. Yet I still like the watch. Other factor is I don't need topomaps, like at all, can't find out a situation where I could possibly use it. So I got the Forerunner and was happy with it for solid 4 months until my family gifted me money for my birthday. And I can't figure out a present for myself. Now the Fenix watch came to my mind. And I rationally know I don't need it. I run and do HIIT and weights regularly, sometimes yoga, swimming or SUP. I listen to music on my runs, yet I carry a phone with me when I go alone to be able to share my location via LiveTrack. I could go for Fenix 5s but I'd lost the music and had to carry phone for every run :/. And also no Garmin pay. Not like my bank would support it and looks like they don't even think about implementing it. But still.So I need you! I need to find a valid reason to not to be spoiled. Main reasons against Fenix 5s+ are: probably too big and heavy, don't need it (especially maps). But it's such a beautiful device. Now if can anyone give me a punch I'd be so grateful! Or any other excuse like there's Fenix 6 coming out next week :D. I have literally zero reasons to upgrade except I like the watch more (I even bough my Forerunner a white band to make it look more like Fenix :D).",garmin

Preferred watch for daily use?,"I been using a Fenix 5 for almost around a year now and I love it! The thing is the watch is way too heavy IMO for daily use, I cant wear it while sleeping or while working can be cumbersome and noticeable. I had a Fitbit Charge 2 before switching to Garmin and I picked it up recently and the difference is very noticeable, the Fenix 5 is 85 grams and the Charge 2 39 grams, wearing the charge I barely notice it.Im looking into getting a watch that Id wear when Im around the house, going to sleep or working, maybe take it out for a walk and keep using the Fenix for my runs and weightlifting and also when I go out since its a nice watch. Im a bit torn about the vivosmart 4 though because I read the screen is not that great, you cant change the straps, and I while I like the form factor and weight (It only weights 18 grams!) I find the screen way too small! I wish it had the Charge 2 size.The other option is a vivoactive 3, which would be nice since it supports music (fenix 5 doesnt) and its light almost the same as the charge 2, however its double the price of a vivosmart and I like the idea of a band form factor rather than having another round clock.The final option is to keep using the charge 2 for daily stuff, but now I have info on garmin and fitbit app and its not very convenient What do you all use for your daily driver? Interested on reading what you like about it and how do you feel it for sleeping and doing chores around the house.",garmin
Vivoactive 3 Music - Bluetooth Hardware Failure?,"I have been using my Garmin Vivoactive 3 Music for about 3 months now.

Convince me to purchase a Forerunner 735xt,"I need some help.&#x200B;I am a runner. I do some biking (not much). I am not a swimmer. I know the 735XT is ""built"" for triathletes, but I seem to be drawn to it anyway. I have been wearing a Garmin Vivoactive HR for the past two-plus years. Although it's not fancy, I love it. It's done me plenty good. I use it for running (races, easy runs, trail runs, and workouts), lifting weights, playing Ultimate Frisbee (running), and hockey. The golf feature has come in hand a few times, too. Nowadays, I don't have much time to play golf though. My main complaint about the Vivoactive HR is that it doesn't offer an exact pace time, as it really only displays the current pace-time as accurate as five seconds.Recently, I've really began to enjoy running again. I'm 34 and spent the whole winter training and challenging myself. I am currently low/mid 37s for 10kms, on pace for a sub 1:20 half, and looking to break 3 hours for a full marathon in the near future.In my opinion, I seem to enjoy everything about the 735XT. I am accustomed to the wrist-based HR. The thing that might intrigue me the most is the Virtual Pacer. I really think it's a pretty cool feature. At the moment, I'm looking to purchase a new watch very soon. My big race is coming up next Saturday and I want to be able to rely on an accurate pace time as much as possible... I want to see 4:09, 4:10, 4:11 exactly throughout the entire race.  Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, guys!",garmin

Garmin 5k training coach program not progressing,"I'm interested to hear about other experiences with the 5k training coaches because mine is feeling pretty useless so far to be honest. I liked that it let me say I could already run for a few minutes at a time so it started me at intervals of running for like 3 minutes, instead of the 30 second intervals when I did the C25k program for the first time. It built up pretty quickly to running three 7 minute intervals, which was 21 minutes of running total.But then for 3 weeks in a row it's just had me run 1 or 1.5 miles, which feels like less of a workout than when I was doing 7 minute intervals. I'm only running for like 9-15 minutes. I would really like to be running more than that!At the end of every workout I mark that it was either ""moderate"" or ""easy.""

links from website not opening correctly in Connect app,"Hi all, when managing the calendar for a club, I put the routes online linking to the Garmin page.

Differences between models,"My employer uses Virgin Pulse, so I get paid if I track my activities(sleep, calories, steps, workouts). I've been looking for a watch but don't know what to get yet. I think I've narrowed it down to a Garmin since smartwatches have terrible battery life. The issue is there are a few too many to me to choose from now.I go to the gym 4 days a week, so I don't need GPS, and would like something that can act at least a little bit like a smartwatch for outside of the gym too (notifications, music control, etc...)After looking around, I think the VA3/M is the best choice for me. But what are the benefits of the higher tiered watches they sell? Just bigger battery or something? I don't want to buy the wrong thing or waste my money on useless features for me. Any help is much appreciated",garmin
Considering moving from Vivoactive to Vivosmart. Thoughts?,"I have been using the original Vivoactive since 2015. It still works great, and has amazing battery life. But it doesnt have the same functionality as the newer devices, and I cant help but contemplate an upgrade. One thing I love about the original Vivoactive is its slim profile. I dont like how bulky the newer versions are.I am wondering if it makes sense for me to switch to a Vivosmart 4, rather than the Vivoactive 3. I rarely use the GPS function these days, and in the instances that I do, I could probably use my phone instead. I mostly do strength training in the gym, and would like a device that can track this, including heart rate. I also want to keep some of the smart watch features like controlling my music app, seeing calls/texts, etc.Other than GPS and Connect IQ apps, is there anything else I would be missing by moving to a Vivosmart?",garmin

That's really all I do. From what I see, the 245 is pretty much a multisport watch now.

Forerunner 45 vs 235,"Hi guys!I've recently started running after having had knee issues for many years. I did a couch 2 5k program last years and now I'm frequently running 5k's at pretty low speeds. I've used endomondo with a chest strap so far but I'm looking at getting a running watch to get more data without needing a subscription, and to be able to glance at my progress while running.I was planning on getting a 235 due to the low price but I waited for the new generation of watches, and got a bit turned off by the price point of thr 245. At the same time, I know I'll become nerdy pretty quickly and will want to see all kinds of data to analyze my progress, in other sports as well.So ny question is, would the forerunner 45 be a step down from the 235 or are they roughly equal, with the 245 taking a step up? I don't want the 235 due to the age, but I don't want to pay more for a worse clock. It's really down to the 245 vs the 45, but to understand if the 45 is worth to buy I think I need to understand how it stands against the former obvious choice for me.I'm leaning towards the 245 to be safe for the future, but if the 45 is equal to the 235 feature wise it might be great bang for the buck to me.Edit:Since the price was the biggest issue with the 245, I ordered directly when I found a 10% Discount code. I can live with spending more money if it'll last longer.Thanks for the advice!",garmin

Fitbit Versa on my wrist and a Vivoactive in my desk drawer. Strava and KOM issues with Versa. Vivoactive viability in 2019?,"Road cyclist.  So yeah, I've set a couple KOMs on Strava with the Versa.

I posted here about it and another redditor here advised me to hard reset (restore factory defaults) and set up the watch again from the beginning.

Forerunner 245 Race Predictor,"My new Forerunner 245 has race predictions that are far too slow - even in the second half of a run the other day, I ran the last 5k over a minute faster than the watch's 5k race prediction. It seems to me like a performance faster than the prediction would override the prediction itself.&#x200B;I understand that the predictions will probably get more accurate as the watch gathers more data, but has anyone else experienced this? From what I have seen, the problem is usually the other way around with the race predictor. For what it's worth, previous training/races were recorded with a Forerunner 25, so no historical heart rate data from before the 245 is available for the watch to analyze.",garmin
Thinking about purchasing Vivomove HR,I currently have a Fitbit flex 2 and I like it because of its simplicity and discreetness. But its starting to not hold a charge and dies more frequently.

Watch Purchasing Advice: Garmin or Samsung (details inside),"Hello everyone,could you please recommend me a Garmin watch, based on this criterias:- I'm not much in a fitness side of things, do some workouts, but not crazy about statistics, aside from HR monitoring and cycling stats- I'd like to use it for hiking (planning and following routes, barometer, altimeter, storm alarms and etc)- This one is harder: I'd like to be able to show only certain notifications (with vibration alert).

Notifications only on watch and not on Phone,"Hi guys,I just got a Fenix 5 and have come from using a Pebble Watch. I have an iPhone as well. My main question is that with my Pebble, I was able to have my phone on Do not Disturb and not receive notifications on my phone but still get notifications on my watch. This made sense to me as that way only the watch would vibrate and my phone would be silent. Then whenever I did not have my watch on me, I could deactivate Do not Disturb and my phone would then vibrate like normal. I am wondering if there is anything similar for Garmin. Currently, if I turn on Do not Disturb, I do not get notifications on either my watch or phone. However when Do not Disturb is off, both my phone and watch vibrate and light up which is annoying. Is there any way to remedy this? Additionally, is there any way to control what notifications are sent to the watch?Thanks,Brandon",garmin

"New Garmin user, FR945 weirdness vs FR935","Hello! I'm new to the Garmin world; bought a FR935 about 3 weeks ago, then the FR945 was announced a week later, so I REI-exchanged the 935 for the 945 with minimal guilt. (I almost never return things, keeping the money in the co-op by exchanging rather than just returning, and I buy from them specifically to make my life easier if I'm not happy). I'm happier with the 945 generally; the screen looks much crisper even though supposedly the resolution is the same -- maybe just the font smoothing or something. I don't like the stacked time display on the default face QUITE as much, though I figure I can fix that somehow. I like the additional space it frees up to display more content though.But, speaking of that content, the sunset thing makes no sense. First of all, it doesn't seem to start counting down until the afternoon (eg, it stays at the 'beginning' end of the range until midday). So I thought maybe it only started counting down from the highest peak. Fine. But in the past few days I've noticed it doesn't seem to update at all sometimes -- it'll show hours left when it's dark, and so on. Any thoughts?Also, the buttons seem... sub-par. Start/stop is perfect. Back/lap seems perfect.""down"" has 2, sometimes 3 detents to trigger (like a camera shutter button you can depress halfway). ""Up"" sometimes seems clicky, sometimes squishy. The ""light"" button isn't quite as precise-feeling as I'd like. From what I can recall, the buttons were perfect on my 935. To be honest, it doesn't bother me THAT much, and if this was my first Garmin, I'd probably not have thought twice about it, but the comparison makes it pretty stark. Ideas? I'd rather not return it for such a silly ""issue"", particularly because I've already returned the 935, and I feel like REI already did right by me. thanks!",garmin

Shout Out to Garmin Customer Service,"I'm a vivomove hr owner, and I love my watch.  It's exactly what I want out of a smartwatch -- an analog look, long battery life, and digital notifications.  It dresses up reasonably and tracks fitness reasonably.  But on Thursday, I almost gave up on Garmin.I was out cutting my lawn, and I put the watch in my pocket to at least get my steps counted.  When I came in and took my watch out of my pocket, it was in Portuguese.  And the date had advanced by 8 days.  And the time had advanced by 5 hours.  And my steps, which should have been around 8,000, were stuck at 1,044.I was super disappointed.  I googled around, found no similar situations, and said to my wife ""I should have just bought an Apple watch.""  I decided I'd give Garmin customer service a try, not knowing whether I'd get quality help or some horrific Comcast-like experience.When I called customer service, they had me install Garmin Express on my Mac.  I did, and then when I rebooted my Mac, it died.  I'm running an upgraded mid 2010 MacBook Pro -- I've sunk a lot of dollars into the machine and intend to run it until it's totally dead (which I accept could be any day now).  So when I rebooted and got an error log the size of Michigan and a notification that said ""Operating System install failed,"" you can imagine my reaction.  I tried to stay calm (and my customer service agent remained calm) despite my broken Mac and broken watch. I went over to my wife's MacBook Air to try to install the software.   I lifted the lid, and nothing.  I banged the power key, nothing.  It was plugged into its charger and d-e-a-d dead.At this point, I'm thinking this is either a dream or the Russians .  My watch was in an alternate, stepless, space-time, my Mac had no OS, and my wife's Mac was dead (which meant I would soon be dead, too).I eventually got my Mac to boot (I'm typing this long post on it now!), and my rep with Garmin helped me reset the watch and remove corrupted files from its file system.  Apparently my watch was attempting to sync a file to my phone, and the sync failed, and the watch then went crazy-go-nuts.  After the reset, the watch was again working perfectly (and has continued to work perfectly since Thursday). This morning I even got my wife's Air booting in Safe Boot -- so I'm almost through my personal technological apocalypse.  Thanks to Kevin and the Garmin customer service team for fixing my watch and keeping me sane while every device I touched died. They spent 70 patient minutes with me -- a customer who has no history with them or loyalty to them.  Or at least didn't until that phone call.TLDR:  My watch went psycho, I called customer service.  While on the phone with Kevin at Garmin, my Mac died and then my wife's Mac died.  I got my Mac to boot and he remained calm and focused and got my watch fixed.  Thanks to Kevin and the Garmin Customer Service team!",garmin

But I don't seem to have access to any historic data?  I went to manage Garmin account and logged in with same details, then synced.  I was assuming my data would be stored by Garmin and would be restored to the phone.Am I doing something wrong?",garmin
"New to Garmin watches, picked up the Vvoactive 3, right choice?","Looking for some input.  Decided to take better care of myself physically, so in addition to better eating, started exercising with elliptical running for around 45 minutes each day.  Decided on Garmin after reading reviews for about a day and picked up the VA3 in slate.  I like the smaller size, so Ill probably stay at 45 or smaller.  Ive only worn it for about 2 days so far and I like it so far, but undecided if I made the right choice.Im admittedly a beginner to running.  I dont see myself running outdoors often, if at all.  I do want to eventually challenge myself to do a 5k, but due to a work schedule and having kids, I dont have the time and safety to run outdoors, so Im restricted to elliptical and treadmill work.  I also plan on just doing basic exercising at the gym with weights and running around and playing with my kids.  So Id want something comfortable and I plan on wearing it 24/7 outside of a few hours at the office when I can charge.Overall I like the VA3 but already I can see many of the issues with the touch screen and having only one button.  Wearing it in the shower and it went crazy.  Wearing it while swimming with the kids yesterday and same thing.  Also having a touch screen (decently responsive) makes operation slower than I think it needs to be.I want something I can use effectively now and grow into the next 1-3 years.  Im not making it like this will be my last option and want it to last for 10 years but also dont want to spend for things that me being a beginner wont fully utilize.  With that being said, Im looking at two models in addition to just also just sticking with the VA3.  245 non-music 235 (not sure if the 245 is worth the extra?)735 XT (not sure whats so different about this one)the new 45 and grow into it.Or I could just keep the VA3 right now and stop over analyzing it.  Im sure I could get used to the touch screen interface if given enough time with it.Id love some thoughts.Edit:I appreciate all of the assistance and insights from everyone.  Found out I could get 30% off the Forerunner 245 non-music and stacked it with 4% cash back with ebates, so ended up with it for $223 after tax, which is less than the VA3 I picked up.  Both would do great for me and Im sure the VA3 wouldve done 100% of what I needed but seems like for the same price (in my case $10 less) its a no brainer to get more for the money.",garmin
Best Value for Running and Fitness Tracking in a Single Watch - Garmin 245?,"I'm looking for the best value in a running watch that would also double as a fitness tracker.  Currently I have a Garmin 220 for running and a Vivosmart 3 for fitness tracking.  I like the stats of the Garmin 245, and also the fitness tracking features.  The Garmin 645 has more features for runners (such as the barometric altimeter), but is $100 more.  I'm thinking the altimeter may be overrated.  I don't do any trail/mountain running, just rail trails with an occasional road race with rolling hills. Thoughts?",garmin
Choosing the correct garmin,"Hi! i'm looking to buy a garmin watch, have had the eye in the 245, but now have some doubts betwen the 245, the 645 music and the 935 (not as mch this one because i do really want muic, but looks to be at a very reasonable price)&#x200B;I'm  a casual runner, mountain or flat terrain, i do swim in pools sometimes, go hiking in the mmountain, and do a lot of interval training, now looking to get a bit more into cycling.Anyhow, i'm more interested in the fitness and health tracking side, i know that the 645 has the barometric altimeter, the 245 has the new senson with sp02.I'm really interested in daily track of y health , hrv, sleep, trainning load, the mixture of all them. i know that 245 tracks hrv in all day stress and the other ones have the 3 minute stress test.&#x200B;Look like the biggest feature the 245 is missing is lactate threshold?which watch would you recommend me",garmin

My old goals doesn't get transferred,"When I used VivoactiveHR for 3 years, I have set custom goals for Floor Climbed, Steps and Intensity Minutes.

FR235 in 2019?,"Hi all,&#x200B;I am a casual runner looking to lose a bit of weight and just get a bit fitter. I'm looking for a Garmin watch after hearing nothing but positive things from friends and family who have the devices. I'm looking at the FR235, as I've found a great deal on it new (127 after some discounts!), however I'm a bit cautious as I'm aware it's a few years old. Are Garmin likely to set the sun on this device soon in terms of support, etc?Other than running, I'll be using it for general day-to-day stuff, like step tracking, and treating it as my everyday watch. &#x200B;I have looked at other possibilities:- FR35 - a bit too bland for my liking. Part of the appeal of the 235 is the customisation. - FR45 - would be PERFECT for a casual runner like me, but obviously this is quite new and there aren't enough reviews to back it up yet. - Vivoactive 3 - haven't read great things (lots of Amazon reviews complaining about it crashing and stuff), and I'm not really sold on the touch screen. &#x200B;So I guess the Tl;dr is: Is the FR235 too outdated? Am I better off with something else? Opinions are greatly appreciated - maybe I've missed a device completely that would be perfect? Really open to any thoughts.&#x200B;Cheers!",garmin

Garmin Music watches for audiobooks,"Has anyone tried to load audiobooks onto your device? If so, what format did you use and what was your experience? I use audible and I don't think it's supported to sync my books to garmin. I can rip them to mp3 but will the watch have a way to bookmark? Should I convert the mp3 to a different format? I also have a few Google audiobooks I could use if that is supported. Thanks in advance for sharing your experiences.Edit: I installed Audible Manager and selected Garmin GPS. When my 645M is plugged in, it says ""Your Garmin Forerunner 645 Music device model is not compatible with Audbile content. Please click OK to see our supported devices in our Device Center.""When I click on OK, it takes me to a page that says ""Listen Everywhere"" but obviously that isn't true.I ended up using OpenAudible to rip to mp3 instead. I was then able to copy to the watch via USB to the audiobooks folder. I copied 2 for testing. If you stop one book and switch to another, or change music sources, the watch remembers where you left off and resumes right from there. So, you can switch to a podcast, music, spotify, etc. and then pick up your book where you left off. Perfect for my needs!",garmin

Do Garmin devices sync Training Status?,When you have a device that supports Training Status and one that does not but still feeds back information to your Garmin Connect account does Training Status still utilize this data?For example if you have an Edge 830 which does not have Training Status but you use also a Forerunner 945.

No SpO2 data on FR245,"Hi all, recently purchased the FR245 music. I can't seem to get any SpO2 data.

Any ideas?Also I worked night shift last night (I have my normal sleep hours as 0000-0700) and the FR245 did not register any sleep when I was in bed this afternoon. Is this due to the data I've entered as normal sleep hours? (I.e. it only looks for sleep during those times)",garmin

Garmin display question,"Hello. I'm currently a Fitbit user but I'm becoming very frustrated with my Fitbit and I'm considering giving Garmin a try.I have a Fitbit Charge 3 and I have a few major issues with its display. There is no way to turn on an ""always on"" display mode (or an ""always on during workout"" mode, for that matter), meaning if I'm in the middle of an intense running/bike workout I often have to repeatedly do the wrist-turn thing to get its display to turn on, which can range anywhere to an annoyance to downright dangerous as it is distracting me from looking where I'm running towards. The workout display text size is also very small and it's extremely hard to read while running, meaning I can't easily tell how far I'm going or how long I've been running. Last, the display brightness sucks and if I'm exercising outside in the sunlight it makes the display even harder to read, coupled with the small text size.I've been looking at the Vivoactive 3 or other Garmins in that price range, but wanted to make sure it would actually be an improvement on these problems. Does it have an always on setting? Is the text size/brightness during an outdoors workout sufficient enough that it's easily readable at a quick glance while running? Thank you!",garmin
"Got new VO2 max, it's now gone...?","Hello,so on Tuesday lunch break I went for my usual short 5k run, I ran it in a record time and also my watch (Fenix 5s+) registered new VO2 max. I was pretty excited about it since I haven't seen the number move for weeks. So I took a screenshot in the Connect app too and also noticed my race predictor updated to even crazier numbers. Anyway today I randomly messed up with the watch and saw the new VO2 max isn't there anymore, it's showing the same number as previously and also the race predictor was back at original values. I thought maybe I got worse again so I checked the Connect but there's no sign of the level going down. The line is flat without any spike that would prove there was the number I have on my screenshot! Am I getting crazy? Since the 5k record on Tuesday, I was out running intervals on Thursday - 5k with 200m sprint and 800m regular tempo - I ended up with almost the same time and pace as on Tuesday so it definitely wasn't such a bad run. Yet it's possible it got me to my previous level of VO2 max but why the Tuesday number isn't visible in the graph in Connect app?!",garmin

"Help? New to fitness trackers, bit overwhelmed.","So, I'm a serious weightlifter with a crappy cardiovascular capacity wanting to improve.With that said, I'm looking for something that mainly tracks my workouts (indoor running and swimming and weightlifting), steps, calories burned, HR and sleep. I don't need a smartwatch or anything fancy that counts reps/laps or storages music. I actually just like the cool stats (since they hold me accountable) and want them to be as accurate as possible. Also, I don't really care if it's touchscreen or not.At first, I went straight to the Fitbit Versa, but the reviews of that watch are just terrible and it looks more like a stylish watch than a actual fitness-focused tracker... A few people on Amazon suggested Garmin as the better tracker. But there are so many options!I'm looking at Garmin's Canadian website right now and there are three trackers around the same price range ($280-300): FR45, FR235 and VA3. They look pretty similar to me, except for the fact that the last two are 2/3 years old and that the VA3 looks more like a multi-sport device (please do correct me if I'm wrong). Also, the FR35 is on sale for $170.Should I go for the VA3 because of the weightlifting/swimming stuff (although I can count my reps/laps) or the FR cause I just need the tracking info? And if I go for the FR, is the 235 still better than the new 45? Is the FR35 really outdated compared to the other three I mentioned?Thanks in advance!Edit: I know about the FR245 and it looks amazing, but it's more than $400. I'm not Canadian (here just for travel) and the currency conversion makes it waaaay more expensive than my budget :(",garmin

Preferred activity tracker,"So my wife got me a Fenix 5 for my birthday since I had been eyeing it for a while once the price dropped and I love it. I thought about using my Vivoactive 3 for sleep tracking and Fenix 5 for everything else and then saw that I wasn't getting sleep data on the VA3 because it's not my preferred activity tracker. So my question is, is that all that that option does? If I set my VA3 as my preferred tracker I don't lose any functionality on the Fenix 5?&#x200B;I actually don't have a problem sleeping with the Fenix 5 since I also have a Gear S3 Frontier that I slept with for a while. It's just so that I don't accidentally hit my wife with the F5 and so that my wrist doesn't get too thin from wearing the F5 all the time :)&#x200B;I searched this sub for preferred activity tracker and couldn't find anything. Thanks for any help.",garmin
Fenix 5 with ErgIQ and Concept 2 ( PM5 ),"So I recently got the Fenix 5X and so far loving this watch. I decided to sync it to my Concept 2 with the ErgIQ app and noticed some odd data points. This morning I did a small 2000m session. I paired my watch up with the rower ( PM5 computer ) that data is then displayed live on my watch. The doesn't matter to me, the real reason for using this is just getting the data into the Garmin Connect app. I use the ErgIQ app downloaded to my watch. Anyway, after rowing I get to work and take a look on my phone and I see this data.. 66 Strokes. Calories Burned 61. Avg HR 96 and Time 10 mins. Now, the only data field that is correct is the time. Everything else is not even close. Maybe the 66 strokes means average? Not sure. Calories.. not sure that's even close. Avg heart rate is really perplexing because I had my Polar strap on and that was also synced to the PM5 and I could see it throughout my workout, and my average was definitely in the 135 range for 10 mins. The other option I have is just select rowing on my watch and just pair it directly to my heart rate monitor and bypass the PM5.. that might be somewhat more accurate. Anyone else running into this?",garmin
Garmin Edge 530 already used?,"I received my Edge 530 today from Cycle Surgery via the post. The package was sealed on arrival and it was parcel force rather than one of the dodgy couriers. However, after opening the package I found the Garmin box already open and the Edge 530 had dust on the screen and the screen protector had bubbles underneath it. Having bought a good number of Garmin watches and devices over the years Ive never seen this before. Turning the Edge 530 on it was ready for setup, but a factory reset could have achieved that. Its a new model and I had trouble finding stock of the unit on its own - wasnt in the premium pack or MTB pack - so Id be surprised if theyre sending our returns already. It works fine and there doesnt appear to be any damage that I can see. But as I paid for new I wanted new. If it was used Id expect a few s off the price. Any thoughts anyone..?Two images here",garmin

FR245 heart-rate from HRM strap for activities where you can't wear the watch,"Hi!I recently bought a FR245, and I want to record my heart rate during indoor climbing, but for obvious reasons I am not wearing the watch while climbing/bouldering. My ingenius idea was to buy a HR strap, wear the strap during climbing, and leave my FR245 20 meters away in the bag. I must not be the only one that does activities where they can't wear the watch, but would love to record the activity, heart-rate, training effect etc.?It doesn't seem easy to find out though whether or how this can work. The only way to know seems to buy both the HRM-TRI and HRM-Dual and try it out, which is not really a good option, for obvious money reasons.ANT+ has a very low range. The HRM-TRI has a cache though and ""offline-sync"". Apparently this does not only work in Swim/OWS activities, but it works for all activities. I found out that Swim/OWS ""offline-HR"" is only supported on the expensive models (e.g. 935/945). But there are forum posts saying that offline-sync HR works on the FR235, for *non-swim* activities (not for OWS/Swim-HR though, for which you need the more expensive watches). It doesn't seem to work on the 645 though.So - how about the FR245? Also my scenario doesn't need full offline/after-activity sync, since I could be in range of the watch every few minutes or so during the activity. I could not find any information online about that scenario.Another idea I had was to buy a HRM strap with Bluetooth LE, which would only be the HRM-Dual from Garmin. BLE might have a larger range than ANT+, and so what I want to do could work, even without HR cache in the strap, if the BLE range is large enough? (Unfortunately the HRM-Dual doesn't have Running Dynamics though which would be a shame).&#x200B;Any input would be much appreciated. Thanks a lot!",garmin

FR 245 music vs 945,"I'm about to purchase my first Garmin watch, and I'm undecided between the FR245 music and the FR945.

If I go for the 245, is there anything else essential I might be missing? (I'm not interested in Garmin Pay).I'm interested in running power as well.

"Time to upgrade my watch, or pay to have it serviced?","Hey r/Garmin , &#x200B;I currently have the Fenix 3 HR and have had it since Cyber Monday of 2016. For the last couple of months I have been having some issues with the watch and yesterday I was able to reach out to Garmin for support. I was informed that after doing a ""full hard reset"" and the problems still occurring, the next step would be to send it in for a software update/repair. The cost of this repair will be $130. &#x200B;I was wondering if you guys think that this is a smart move or if you think I would be better off upgrading?

FR945 as a backpacking watch?,"Hi all,TL;DR - 945 or Fenix 5 Plus?A question from someone considering the jump to Garmin* -Backstory: About 2-3 times a year, I go out on backpacking trips (3-4 days each) + day hikes/overnighters throughout the year - you won't find me in some exotic northface commercial locale, but the locations can get tough and I usually get banged up -At home, I primarily run, but also am thinking of getting a bike to increase variety. Triathlons have always intrigued me, but I've never made any concrete steps towards doing one (though would like to).A few days ago, I actually pulled the trigger on the Fenix 5x Plus (REI sale, etc.), but ended up returning it because it was just too massive - but the features, build, and quality stood out - I was going to go back and grab the 5 Plus, but saw the 945 came out - and they're more or less the same price at this point... with the 945 picking up some cool features like acclimation, pulse ox (the 5 plus doesn't have this), and training load whatever.However, when one goes to Garmin's website, they tend to market the 945 as a triathlon watch with an emphasis on road running - if you tap on their Hiking/Backpacking watches, they really only recommend the Fenix.Build quality and durability are important to me - I'm a 100% believer in sapphire glass - I've owned a few Seiko's whose faces are impeccable because of that glass. However, I've been using an Apple Watch Series 2 for the past 3 years, and the Ion-X screen has performed admirably in the above activities I do. Definitely some scratches, but that's character. Any thoughts on the FR945 as a backpacking watch? If not for the build materials, I wouldn't hesitate for a second to get it over the 5 Plus - I really don't have any experience with Garmin so if folks could speak to the build quality, that would be great.Cheers",garmin

It would also give me tons of new metrics, which I'm going to have to find my way around them as they're new to me.

Big Undisclosed Features?,Is anyone else under the impression that there may yet be big undisclosed features of the Apple Watch? Things that may be announced at the upcoming release event? If all Apple really has to disclose is technical details and battery life I feel the event would be underwhelming. I wonder if perhaps they gave us the basics in September only to reveal much more later (They even said at the end of the event that it was capable of much more than they had disclosed).,applewatch

iPhone 4S Owners: What will you do when the AppleWatch gets released?,"Yeah, since we all know, the 4S doesn't support the AppleWatch anymore, not even with the strongest hacks, because of new Hardware coding.It's like those NVRAM stuff you can't change, or the 3.5 inch screen's max resolution before the Screen starts to warp on the iPhone.So, what you gonna do next March, April.Buy a new iPhone?Do nothing?Get a different smartwatch like the AlcatelWatch?Wrrrrrite me your comments, down here!

What in the hell did Apple do to the Astronomy face?,"Back when the watch was first revealed, the astronomy face with the 3D Earth looked beautiful. Clearly Apple was proud of it too because it was the very first face ever shown to the public in the Reveal video. Now though, they completely changed the look of the Earth, removing most of the beautifully detailed cloud cover and changing the shading to make the ocean look like badly-done CGI from the 90's. I don't think there were performance issues as the face was running perfectly fine in Kevin Lynch's demo as well as the hands-on at the September event and even that picture of Mark Newson wearing it in public. So is there any other reasoning behind making it so much uglier? Just look at the two pictures and tell me if you didn't know better, you wouldn't think the current face came from earlier in development than the original.",applewatch

Any thoughts/ideas about a buyback or exchange program?,"One shocker from today is that Tim Cook totally neglected to mention any sort of buy back program or exchange for the Apple Watch. While some people think this means there's simply no such program, I believe they might not have wanted to mention it at this point, as the Apple Watch hasn't even come out yet, and it would be ridiculous to already mention the concept of a gen two. Surely there's got to be some sort of program, at least for the Edition watches, as even Apple knows dumping 17k on a watch that becomes obsolete in two years is stupid. Here's my theory: Apple will offer some sort of buyback/exchange/chip swap for the Apple Watch (regular) and Edition, but not the Sport. To me, the Edition and regular feel more premium, and it seems to me that you're paying for the fashion as well as functionality. If you just want the watch, no frills, you obviously go for the Sport, as the other two lines have the same functionality, but if you care about fashion, status, etc. you buy a regular or Edition. Also, the Sport is (kinda) reasonable to replace every two years, at $350, where as the higher end regular, and especially the Edition watches, are simply way too expensive.The problem for me right now is I'm torn between the 42mm Space Grey Sport, or the 42mm regular with sport band. Both look cool, but I'm obviously partial to the regular's stainless steel over the Sport's aluminum. So right now I'm debating whether to go for the regular, with the better looks and a chance of an exchange down the road, or if I take the safe bet and go for the Sport. Any advice? I'm also curious to see if anyone agrees/disagrees with my theory.",applewatch

"I created a concept for a Reddit app for the Apple Watch, would love to hear some opinions and feedback on it!","#Thank you everyone for the feedback!  I've taken most of the feedback and incorporated it into a mini-redesign.  Changes:App has been slimmed down.  Instead of being able to choose subreddits individually you can view the front page, which contains posts from your subscribed subreddits.  Or you can view all of the posts from all subreddits.Gone is the Apple-style home screen, replaced with a choice between the previously mentioned options.Also yanked was the ability to view individual subreddits on the home screen.  This should help to greatly reduce the scope of the app, and pushes it slightly to be more suitable for a watch.Front page changed yet again.  This time it is in a list view.  Gone is swiping to upvote/downvote.  Navigating up and down will be done by the digital crown.Hello everyone!First things first:If there are any developers out there who would like to partner with me to make this concept into an actual app, please PM me.The app is tentatively called Watchit.  (Watch + Reddit = Watchit.)With that out of the way, let's get to some images.##Front-facing mockups####SpringboardThis is the icon for the app, surrounded by all of the apps on your device.####Home ScreenThis is the main home screen of the app.  Here you can choose between the front page of all your subscribed to subreddits, or browse all posts from all of the subreddits.  Note this has changed from before.####Front page/All pageThis is the screen where most of the magic happens.  Here, the posts for the subreddit you are currently in are displayed.  This for example is how the front page might look, and this same visual style will apply to all pages.####Full Screen view, Upvoting/Downvoting a postSimply tapping on a post will enlarge the picture or title of the post so you can view it as large as the screen allows.  Tapping close will bring you back to the subreddit.####Force Touch Context MenuForce touching on a post will bring up a context menu where you can save the post to your Reddit account, share it, or send it to your iPhone where you can view the post within the companion iPhone app.####Short Look NotificationFrom the Apple Design Guidelines:  ""Short Looks let the user know which app received a notification and are visible only briefly."".In the Watch app, you will be able to be notified whenever a new post becomes the top post on the front page.  The interval at which this happens can be set within the companion app.  It can update in real time whenever positions change, or for example every 30 minutes.  Whichever you choose.####Long look Notification (1)####Long Look Notification (2) (What you see when you scroll down)From the Apple Design Guidelines:  ""Long Looks provide more detail about an incoming notification.""In this app, Long Look notifications will show what the current post is (its content and its title.)  From the notification, you will be able to upvote, downvote, or save the post, as well as being able to dismiss the notification.##Mockups of the app on some select Watch designs.####Here is the mockup.  Unfortunately the template I had only had one option for the Watch and Edition models.    tl;dr:  Created a design for a Reddit Apple Watch app.View all the images in this album.##Some info on the iPhone App.I haven't yet designed the iPhone App that would ultimately ship with it.  The primary focus of the iPhone App would be to drive the Watch app.  When you send a post from the Watch and to your phone, you will be able to view the post on your iPhone.  I haven't decided how complex the iPhone app should be, but you'll be able to use it instead of the Watch if you so desire, with commenting, reading comments, and reading articles a stock feature.  Pricing hasn't been decided, but likely no more than $0.99.Enjoy!Ryan",applewatch

Ion-X or Sapphire Glass that is the question,"Well, I have all the intentions of buying an Apple Watch, but I have ran into a dilemma of durability of each model Stainless Steel vs Sport.My very first venture into the smart watch scene was with the Pebble through Kickstarter.  I got my Pebble and enjoyed it quite a bit, until scratches started showing up on the face of the watch.I am not really rough on watches, I just wear a watch constantly and it evidentially got scuffed up over time.  I have other watches that are sapphire crystal and the face looks immaculate to this day, but most have a bezel protecting the crystal.  My concerns are like anyone else shattering the crystal.  I workout on an everyday basis and I always wear a watch no matter what I am doing.  I am concerned with the Ion-X and scuffing the glass up with scratches, while I am concerned shattering the sapphire glass.  What should I do? I will definitely purchase Applecare upon release and give myself some piece of mind.I have seen videos where sapphire crystal is tested and it seems very durable with certain impacts, generally the drop test seem the worse, due to the shock absorption of the sapphire glass.  I personally see myself more prone to scratching the crystal then anything, rather than impacting it; but you never know.",applewatch

[Prediction] Most Popular Apple Watch,I am going to predict that four of the following apple watches will be the most desirable.Watch Sport White or Black bandsApple watch SS with white or black sport bandsI think the pricing hits a sweet spot for most consumers willing to pay for something new.I chose white and black because they seem to be the most versatile colors to wear something with.Women will opt for 38mm sports watch because they will likely like the lightweight 25g vs 40g 38mm from the SS Apple watch.I also predict that the Watch Sport Black band and black watch face are so similar to the Apple watch SS with black band that to the consumer may deem the watch hard to justify the added cost simply at face value . We all know the increased quality of material etc.My prediction is that people will start lower and buy an entry level Apple watch and upgrade their bands when necessary. Why? New category of technology to many. The functionality may not seem appealing to all. People are not in lucrative cellular contracts with credit that can be applied to a new device like an iPhone. This is definitely a luxury piece of tech. People don't know that it's not more than you need but more than they are used to. Apple and many companies are here to create that need when it doesn't really exist. That is apparent with all the mainstream skepticism on wearable technology you hear about on the news. Thus I predict it will be a slow yet very lucrative market that will complement our desires to get a new ithings every year.These are my predictions..... What does the community think ?,applewatch

"The ""killer feature"" of the Apple Watch","Note: The following is a self-post that I submitted on /r/Apple a couple days after the Spring Forward event. I was responding to someone who had asked whether or not they should purchase the Watch. It was not well received, mostly due to the overbearing negativity that dominates that subreddit. I think people here may grasp my ideas better. EnjoyThe fact of the matter is, you don't need it anymore than you need a tablet over a laptop. Or a smartphone over a flip phone. What the Apple Watch is in it's purest essence, is the final connection between between humans and technology. It is the final resting place that our technology will ascend (before it enters our bloodstreams and brains). Computers began forging their connection to us decades ago with the first PCs. Then, laptops allowed us to bring our technology first to our kitchen table and later, with increased portability, onto flights and nearly anywhere we chose. Then came tablets, which allowed us to hold the power of a laptop in our hands. Phones, (although chronologically prior to tablets) went a step further, with extreme connectedness, power, and a world of possibility slipping into your pocket. But this steady transition of technology integrating into our lives is not over yet. The next spot is our wrists, and it is one of the biggest issues that has existed in each advancement I named above. You see, as technology has gotten smaller, more powerful, and more portable, it has still been relatively unchanged in the fact that whenever you sit down at your iMac, open your MBP, or unlock your iPhone, you are sucked away from reality in the form of a glowing screen that commands your entire attention away from your surroundings.Despite the small size of your iPhone, whenever it buzzes in your pocket, you still need to reach in, pull it out, unlock it-- and then-- you are in the device, your attention fully on the content of the screen. You may look away, but the device still has your attention (and for that matter is more likely to suck you into checking another application after you complete that task). How many tables of people have you walked past in a restaurant with their heads stuck in their phones, barely communicating? A lot, probably. The fact of the matter simply is that even though your phone screen may be small, whenever you turn it on, even for the simple task of checking the weather, you are taken out of the moment and are more likely to remain distracted.This is where the Apple Watch comes into play. Rather than staring at the glowing rectangle of your phone, you will be able to access (as well as input) the same information as your phone with a mere glance (or a few taps) at your wrist. If you get a text, you see in on your arm (you don't have to open it; you could dismiss it by covering the watch face with your other hand if you want), and if want to respond, the watch enables you to do so with an ease and swiftness simply not available on the phone. (If you would like to type a longer or more detailed response your are welcome to take it out however)The ability to do things like this translate to all aspects of the Apple Watch-- in other words, your technological world will blend into your physical reality as seamlessly as a glance at your wrist. And the value of this is far more than you think.It fills the missing gap in Apple's product line-- it holds the final connection between you and your technology (and all the connectedness that comes with it) while simultaneously keeping you connected to the things that really count: your physical reality. Apple has come under some criticism for their lack of what many people call a ""killer feature"". Well that isn't true. The Apple Watch ""killer feature"" is how personal it is, how personal it can be (in it's myriad of customization options), and how much it will allow it's users to be more personal with their surroundings.I know, it sounds like a joke. But deep down, this is what will make the Apple Watch a hit. And you know, if you don't buy it in a month it's ok. Because I can guarantee it that you, along with everyone else, will have one in 3 years.Do you value time? Most people do-- many of technologies biggest hits of the past ten years are as huge as they are because they save their users more time than the old fashioned way of doing things.You probably don't think about the amount of time it takes to reach into your pocket (or purse for that matter), grab your phone, unlock it, and then do what you intended to do/see what you intended to see on it, but those instances take up time, and that time adds up. Having the information from your phone (in addition to who even knows what else) on your wrist opens up thousands of possibilities but more importantly saves you your valuable time.Ok.Need to check if it's gonna rain in an hour? Raise your wrist and 3 seconds later you know to grab an umbrella.Who won the game last night? Raise your wrist and check your Apple Watch glance widget-- 5 seconds later and you know.Want to buy a Poweraide at a vending machine? Hold your wrist up to the sensor and 2 seconds later the transaction is complete.Virtually every aspect of the Watch is designed to help it's users save their valuable time. And if time is money, I don't mind paying for that. (So I guess this Watch is technically paying for itself? I joke but you have to imagine the benefits)The fact of the matter is that I could go on for hours about the notifications, the personal new ways to communicate, the endless potential for home automation, not to mention the fitness features which provide plenty of reason to buy it in and of itself. (I haven't even begun to talk about the MASSIVE, MASSIVE potential of apps on the device). But I won't. Because really, when you think about it, in 3 or 5 years from now, when technology has finished it's journey from our desks to our pockets to our wrists (just as actual clocks did in years past), people won't question buying an Apple Watch any more than people question buying a new pair of shoes or a new iPhone.And if you're concerned about the pricing, dont be.The Sport edition actually has quite the fair price when compared to other fitness bands the amount of features/ the quality of their experience. The stainless steel edition is also priced competitively when it comes to analog watches of a similar price scale (and it looks just as good). And obsolescence is certainly something to consider, but I urge you to look past our current tech outlook. With the Apple Watch applications mostly being run on the iPhone, I don't think we should expect to see increasing performance issues as the years pass by in the same way we do on iPhones. Expect to get between 3-5 years out of you Apple Watch (Apple could potentially even replace your battery for you). You may not want to upgrade your Watch that often but when these things hit mainstream, get used to it (after all, we replace our smartphones without little fuss every 2-3 years). But expect your second purchase Apple Watch to much improved from your first, i.e. with countless biometric sensors and more. There is also the exciting potential that a later model could be sold by health insurance companies at a subsidy in the same way as iPhones were once they gained 3G-- with a smaller down payment with the rest of the Watch being paid off in your healthcare bill over time. Think prices along the lines of $99 for the Sport, $199 for the Watch and (cough) $3,000 for the Edition. And the $10,000 Edition? Don't get your panties in a bunch regarding those-- they aren't aimed towards people like us; they're just a clever way to raise the overall status and appeal of all the Apple Watches as a whole.So buy it now, or don't. But if you choose to wait, I look forward to hearing about your wonderful experiences with the 2017 Apple Watch Sport. Because we are just on the tip of the iceberg for these babies.Cheers.TLDR: The Apple Watch will add value to your life in ways that cannot be measured such as reconnecting you to reality, saving you time, and overall improving your quality of life. Oh yeah, and it looks as good too.Edit: Thanks for the Gold!",applewatch

"As the Watch is soon to come out, I want to think about what could be next. (x-post from /r/Apple)","t'was the night before pre-orders and all through the house, nobody was sleeping, not even the (magic) mouse,all were on iPhones and iPad air 2s,on Macbook and iMacs and Mac minis too,all had their favorite watches selected.even iFixit waiting for the gold one to be dissected.now iCan't do poems so I shall stop now,and get to the text post you all wanted...sh*t, what rhymes with now...?So the apple watch is about to be out and I want to make and hear your predictions (both big and small) about the Watch 2 or S or whatever. I have my money on 3 things:1, Apple watches will be few and far between: because of a $10,000  gold apple watch, if there is a 2016 $10,000 Watch edition S, apple will have dug themselves into a hole. If they do a trade in program, they will show how much the gold watches are really worth. I say they will release them with every 2 or even 4 iPhones. The iPhone 6 gets one so the Watch 2 will launch with the iPhone 7 or iPhone 8.2, MAJOR redesign for each apple watch: going back to $10,000 for an apple watch, there better be a reason for plunking down another 10k or even 500 for the same goddamn thing with a different charging port or a camera.3, The Watch will probably follow in the iPad's footsteps. This is what I have the most money on. With it getting better and better and the interest just falling off.But I don't know, What do you think is next for 's newest product.",applewatch
"After seeing the pictures of Apple Watch, I'm swaying more towards the Apple Watch Sport","So after seeing the images of Christy Turlington Burns' Apple Watch, on apple.com where she is changing straps, Im really not liking the mirrored look the Apple Watch has.

Is it just me or does this not look good at all?http://www.apple.com/watch/christy-turlington-burns/Think ill be going for the, Space Grey, Apple Watch Sport now.However I do feel that once I see them in the flesh on the 10th, my mind will change once more!",applewatch
Can an Apple Watch band be a GPS?,I do a bit of running.  Whilst I will buy an Apple Watch when they are released one of the things that saddens me is the lack of a built in GPS.  Is there any chance that a 3rd party manufacturer could create a watch band that had a separate battery and GPS?  Would it communicate with the phone via Bluetooth?  Could this work?,applewatch
Can I put a delivery hold on Apple shipping?,"I intend to place my watch order online (assuming I can do so) on the 10th. I don't need to see it in person (I've had a pebble for well over a year so smart watches aren't anything new to me) and I don't need a tiny 15-minute slot for an Apple Store rep (nice enough as they are) to stroke my ego and tell me the watch looks good on me.I just plan to order.The problem is, I will be out of town the 20th-26th of April ... and I don't want the box sitting on my doorstep for a couple days.  I could ask a neighbor to watch for it and grab it, but if there's an easy way to delay delivery via the Apple online store - it might just be easiest to do that.Is there a way to do that?

Apple Watch without iPhone?,"I was wondering how the Apple watch will work when away from iPhone. For example, if I accidentally leave my phone at home, will it still push through notifications over the Internet, or is wifi/Bluetooth only dedicated to connecting with the iPhone?",applewatch

What would you do eith your AppleWatch in the winter?",applewatch
Avoiding the Tyranny of Notifications?,"Like many of you, I'm thinking about getting an Apple Watch sometime this year.I work at a software company (where we naturally have quite a few early adopters) and I've seen a few people now wandering around with smart watches of one kind or another. There have been some interesting ones, although the more I see them, the more I think that Apple's design is the least ""gadgety"", which is probably a good thing.I mention this because a collague was showing me her watch on Friday (I think it's the new Samsung Galaxy Gear) with Android Wear on it. It was fairly smooth/fluid and such, and looked to work well enough (although it had a heart attack when she got too far from her phone...)But what was interesting was that she pretty much had all of her phone notifications going to her wrist. She thought this was convenient. I said to her ""Yes, it's a great idea, but sometimes I want to deliberately put my phone in a drawer or leave it on my desk, because I don't necessarily want to be notified all the time about everything.""I already feel that with a smart phone, I've become (like many others) fairly bound to the idea of constant notifications. I'm used to it, and being without it feels weird. At the same time, I'm now starting to limit what apps can notify me - even on my phone - because I'm kind of tired of being constantly bombarded by alerts about everything all the time.So, in terms of the Apple Watch, I'm thinking that when I get one I will probably keep the notifications as minimal as possible. Aside from perhaps text messages and calendar alerts/reminders, I may restrict pretty much everything else - possibly even phone calls, come to think of it.I'm curious to know: for those of you who are looking to get one of these, and who are otherwise new to the smart watch phenomenon...what's your view on notifications? Will you have all of your phone notifications coming to the watch, or only a subset? I'm starting to think that unless I deliberately do this restriction, I'm just going to be constantly subject to being contacted by apps, which isn't necessarily convenient or desirable for me.What do you guys think?",applewatch
Question for you dudes getting the silver AppleWatch Sport.,"What color band are you getting???I really prefer the silver version over the black. And I'm pretty sure I'll be swapping out one of the bands I get for the black one on strapswap.com, but I'm still not sure what other color to get?What color band are you guys getting with the silver AppleWatch Sport?",applewatch
Will AppleCare protect against water damage?,"Now that Apple has officially given the Apple Watch an IPX7 rating, would Apple repair watches under AppleCare if they were damaged from taking a shower?  I'd say this is a pretty important question considering most people are concerned (and excited) about taking such a pricey gadget in the shower with them.  For those who don't have the International Protection Marking Code index; memorized, IPX7 refers to #7 of the Liquid ingress protection code.  #7 states:  Ingress of water in harmful quantity shall not be possible when the enclosure is immersed in water under defined conditions of pressure and time (up to 1 m of submersion). It further states that, ""Test duration: 30 minutesThe lowest point of enclosures with a height less than 850 mm is located 1000 mm below the surface of the water, the highest point of enclosures with a height equal to or greater than 850 mm is located 150 mm below the surface of the water.""  Clearly this sounds like it will protect against shower use but do IP rating codes vouch safe for warranties?  I think somehow that it would not, but considering the amount of people that will attempt a shower with their watch bares consideration, especially if Tim Cook is publicly mentioning doing it.  As a random side note:I use an ECOPEBBLE Bluetooth Speaker in my shower.  The company carries many products and considers them ALL ""Waterproof. Fully submersible in Water"", except the only speaker displaying an IP rating for is the Pebble, which as you can see in the link is IPX7.  I haven't been using it very long but it works 'okay', but when water gets sprayed into the speaker it can have intermittent sound loss, almost like popping.  So take that for what you will.  Any thoughts?  Anyone have experience with Apple devices and AppleCare that could shed some light on this?",applewatch
What combination are you getting?,"There have been a few threads of people asking for opinions of strap combinations (including me) so let's just have one big thread of what you are getting.I'll be getting the 42mm, Space Gray Aluminum, Green Band.Need help deciding: MixYourWatch.com",applewatch
How long does the display stay on?,"Personally I find the design of the watch kind of boring when the screen is off, so I'm interested if anyone has seen any hands-on videos showing how long (30 seconds, a minute?) the display stays on after you're done using it (or after sensing wrist motion).

Anyone want to swap the spate strap? (I'm Buying white but also want black),I'm buying the 42mm applewatch sport with white bands. I'll have no need for the spare 38mm strap that comes with it. Anyone want to swap with a spare black 42mm sport band?? Edit. I meant white not spate.,applewatch

Apple Watch for Sleep Tracking?,"Of course, with all the talk about the Apple Watch for fitness (plus barometer for getting flights climbed data into my old 5s), pulse, etc...

They're using Apple's images and the price is exactly half.Still, if I buy the stainless steel with a black sports band and then one of these at $75, I still save $25 and end up with two bands: one for the gym and one for going out.But still, it's sketchy right?",applewatch
Is it safe to assume that the Space Gray Watch Sport is going to have an identical finish to the Space Gray iPhone 6?,"Still torn between the silver and the gray version of the Sport.

Apple Watch Preorder Clarification,"So I couldn't find anything on if your card will be charged the moment you preorder or when it is shipped.

How long does the preorder last?,"I have preordered games before and usually with that you can preorder all the way up until the release date. Is that the same with the apple watch?

What confuses me about these Apple Watch arguments.,"In almost every youtube impression video I've seen so far, & every post I've seen here, people have said, ""what's the point in buying the Apple Watch when I can do everything it does on my phone already?""... Is there a smart watch available right now that I can't say the same thing about?Also, people have been saying they don't want the Apple Watch as a primary input device, that smart watches are meant to just let me take a quick glance at my notifications and nothing more... ... but isn't that a bit more useless than a device where you CAN make proper inputs on? The same way you can look at your notifications on your watch is the same way you can do it on your phone. So what exactly is the argument here?Not an Apple fanboy or anything, but some of these reasons not to buy that I've been seeing aren't holding any solid ground. You might as well get rid of the smart watch genre altogether if these are the arguments you will make against the Apple Watch.",applewatch

Seeing these same questions posted over and over is mildly annoying, and I don't think I'm the only one who feels this way.Maybe at least we could have a couple common posts stickied to the front page, such as the ""Which model/combo are you getting?"" thread.  It's not that I think these threads are pointless, I just think it's pointless to have multiple posts about the same topic.",applewatch

Jailbreak Possibility,"I didn't actually think about this until just recently, but how likely is a jailbreak without a physical port on the device?

"I really want to shed more bucks to get the Black SS watch, but the lack of suitable bands really turn me off...","I'm planning to replace my years old Seiko SS Kinetic watch. So I believe I will go on with the Steel selection. Plus, I'm mesmerized by the Space Black SS watch, but the thought of spending an extra $300 making me unable to choose the milanese loop or the SS classic buckle just puts me off...I know all the bands are compatible with all the watch cases with the respective sizes, but where the bands connect to the case there will be a disturbing color difference. I really wish Apple made optional bands with space black attachment parts.Mind you, I really like the black link bracelet that comes with the watch, but my whole topic is about the alternative choices. How would you choose your bands if you decided to purchase the Black SS watch? Or would you rather recommend getting the regular SS and have more bracelet options?",applewatch
Anyone here using Apple gift cards through passbook to pre order the applewatch?,"I added an iPad to my cart to see if paying with passbook was a possibility, but I didn't see that as an option.

I'm torn between the 38mm and 42mm.,"I've been going back and forth in my head for weeks now about if the 38 or 42 would be a better size. I'm a teenage guy and have somewhat small wrists, but I wonder if it will be harder to read text on a smaller screen. I see tons of shots of the 42 on people's wrists and they don't look large... It  makes me wonder how small the 38 is in person. So I have 2 questions: Is it plausible to preorder the same watch in both sizes, check out the watches in the store that morning, and cancel the order I don't want? Any photos/info that might make me feel more comfortable about the size of the 38?EDIT: Thanks to everybody for your valuable input.

Apple Watch - Upgrading from Version 1 to Version 2?

Anyone agree with me here (particularly SS buyers who were considering switching to sport but decided against it)?",applewatch
It will be interesting to see a review now iOS 8.3 is out,A common theme amongst the reviews I have been reading say that some apps that use the iPhone's location services and data services can take a little while to get the information However all these reviews would have either been using iOS 8.2 or a beta of 8.3I'd like to see another review now that iOS 8.3 is released and see if there has been and changes to this?I think the reason Apple released this yesterday and not next week when the watch is out of for the retail experience that will be happening from Friday. Get bugs ironed out and sort timing issue with certain apps. Makes perfect sense However does anyone think we will see another update come the 24th?

What is the possibility of a jailbreak tweak to allow an Apple Watch to be paired with an iPhone on an iOS lower than 8.2?,"I, like I suspect many others, am still running iOS 8.1 wih a jailbreak on my iPhone 6. As the watch pairing app was only introduced with iOS 8.2, and now subsequently 8.3 has been released with no jailbreak in sight, does anyone see a possibility of a jailbreak tweak to maybe port the watch app from 8.2 into an older iOS? I am certain I am not the only one who sees this as an issue. I do not enjoy iPhones without a jailbreak and the prospect of losing the break, particularly given another one looks a while off with Apple patching a lot of exploits in 8.3, is a concerning trade off to getting the watch. If anyone has heard anything about a ported watch app, thinks its possible or knows its possible, I and many others would love to hear about it. Cheers.",applewatch

An Apple Watch App I Think Is Useful - disclaimer I made it :),"So the idea is, and I know you've likely experienced this, you are sitting in the movie theater wondering ""How much longer is left in this movie?!""  With the newly approved Movie Hype app extension for Apple Watch you can wonder no more! (trying to sound like Billy Mays here) The watch app knows the runtime of all in theater and recent in home movie releases. Simply select the movie you are watching and the watch will display a running countdown timer with the exact length of the film. A quick glance at your wrist will let you know the time left so you can adjust your seating position or go grab a quick snack. Future enhancements to the watch app include customized alerts of interesting facts pertaining to the film as they occur  on screen and haptic feedback indicating a good time to relieve yourself when a lull in the action is about to occur.ImageDownload linkLet me know what you think!",applewatch

Issue with Apple Pay during ordering. Did this happen to anyone?,I tried ordering the watch and checking out with Apple pay but I had an error each time with my address. I tried 2 cards and two watched and each time it said billing address did not match. I tried manually re-entering the address even though it was correct. I didn't have my wallet with me so by the time I put my card in manually to checkout without Apple pay the ship date already changed to the 4-6 week ship time. I read somewhere on here that people had Apple call them up to verify billing info. I wonder if they had some sort of issue somewhere. Anybody else have this issue when they tried to order?,applewatch
No Reminders app on Apple Watch?,"I don't know how I didn't notice before, but is there really no Reminders app on the Watch? This is something that I just assumed was on it and never specifically looked I guess. That was one of the things I expected to use the most on my watch. One of my biggest issues with Reminders on iPhone is how often I miss the fucking alerts because I don't notice them in my pocket. Reminders seems perfectly suited for the Watch. View simple lists, add to or edit the list with Siri, remind at times or locations, etc... I don't understand how that wouldn't be an essential function of the platform. I'm pretty stunned it's nowhere to be found and I don't see anyone mentioning its absence in reviews or anywhere else.

Woo Hoo!,"I tried on a SS 42 mm with black sport band today at the local Apple store.  (The same model I pre-ordered.)  Loved the feel and look.  The Apple employee swapped out several bands for me.  My favorites were the sport with its soft, almost fuzzy, texture and the black, classic buckle.  The Milianese loop was snazzy and I loved the magnetic closure, but I'm not a metal band guy.  I didn't like the feel or appearance of the segmented, leather loop.  The perfect band for dress occassions might be the simple leather of the classic but with a magnetic closure.I was wearing a dress shirt and sport coat--the 42 mm fit under the cuff with no problem.Oh yeah, the watch itself...wonderful.  I'll do my best with any questions.",applewatch

Just got back from my try on session. 42mm SS with Milanese loop.,"I have 190mm wrist, and this watch fit perfectly. The weight felt like that of a quality watch, the sapphire screen was a dream to touch, the digital crown felt really natural, and the haptic feedback was incredibly subtle and discreet. The heart rate thing on the bottom didn't seem to add much, if any elevation off my wrist. The band was amazing. It was light weight, flexible, and the magnet is very strong. I don't anticipate it slipping at all. As an added bonus, the lady asked what my ship date was and I told her I got the 24th and she told me that I'm only the second person that she's talked to who got that date. Then again I'm not incredibly surprised. There've only been a handful of people in my area that seem to be interested in the watch (I work for an electronics retailer, so the quarry come up often), and Sacramento isn't quite Cupertino after all. I'm so extremely happy with the quality and feel of this product. I've never ordered first gen Apple (other than the iPhone), but I feel very confident in this purchase.",applewatch

Prep-work for those waiting their Apple Watch pre-order,"We all have nothing to do but wait, right?

But now I don't have to unlock my phone to read it, since I'm not concerned about that privacy when a watch is attached to my wristAnything else that y'all can think of?",applewatch

Not all charging stands work with all bands...?,"Many of the third party charging stands popping up feature designs that would require the band to be completely opened.

Have You Ever Stood On Line For A Product?,"I'm just asking because there are some people who seem to want this situation, some who are against it. I had stood on line for an iPhone 4 (iirc) at the NYC 5th Ave store. It was a pleasant experience.Fastforward to last fall. I got an iPhone 6+ a bit after launch through ATT, which was then stolen. After asking an Apple employee at the SoHo NYC store if they would have stock (and being told they did, every day, get a new shipment) I stood on line for four days in a row, getting there at 6am to 7am, only to be told after a wait of one to four hours that I could not get a phone - save for the last day, after four or five hours, when I was one of the lucky few who did get a phone.The line was mostly filled with people on vacation and foreign buyers who seemed like they were taking orders for other people. Regardless, this was well after the iPhone 6+ and iPhone 6 launch, and simply going to the store to get a phone was a horrible experience. And I needed a phone, so I had to do this every day until it worked. You could not order a phone online and request store pickup because they were always marked as shipping in X weeks. I was told you could try refreshing the page at midnight and it may update; it did not.I know it sucks to get a late ship date, but the online order process for the Apple Watch seems a billion times better than the hell (I mean, relatively speaking) I went through to get a supply constrained iPhone.",applewatch

Sizing tip with the Apple Store App previews,"Had a try-on appointment today, as well as a realisation.Everyone has pointed out the the Watch seems way smaller in person - true! But, how small?I found that comparing the two side by side, the scale image of the 38mm Watch seems the same as the real 42mm.Totally an illusion, but if you haven't been able to make it in to a store to see the Watch in person, there's a pretty decent reference for you.",applewatch
What are your thoughts/plans for Gen 2?,"While we're waiting I've done some thinking some about Gen 2.  Listening to the reviews I've come to the following guesses:We've got two years until a refresh.Built-in GPSThinnerLarger HD (will become necessary with native third party apps.)Faster (though this will also be due to software optimization.)Increased Battery Capacity (mostly counteracted by the previous changes leading to a similar functional battery life.)Maybe a camera?What I'm less certain of is where that will leave the first model?  Do you think Apple will offer any kind of buy-back plan?  Will a thinner be backwards compatible in terms of bands?(Obviously we're guessing here, but I'd love to hear some speculation.)What is your attitude about Gen 2?  Is it something you've put any thought into?",applewatch

Apple watch steps to Fitbit app,I've been using a Fitbit for the past year and a lot of my friends and family have one. We compete against each other on the Fitbit leaderboards. I know Fitbit recently introduced mobiletrack which basically imports the motion data from your iPhone into the Fitbit app. I'm hoping that once I set the watch up it'll automatically sync my step count w the motion data and then I can sync with Fitbit through mobiletrack. Anyone else interested in this or have any thoughts on it?,applewatch

Changing watch face colours,"I just used a watch in the store and I'd like to know how the same team that made the excellent overall Watch UI was also responsible for this usability nightmare? Changing the colour of the second hand is easy enough because each colour slides out from the top as you scroll (although it's finicky because you can never tell if you've gone far enough to get to the new colour or revert back), but whoever decided changing the background colour of the face would work by scrolling through hues and locking you on a single one is an idiot. It's impossible to tell when you've reached a new colour, and half the time after I scrolled from, say, blue to a lighter blue, it would just reset back to dark blue if I released the crown, or jump way ahead to yellow. It's even worse on the Chrono face, where the colours are so subtle it's almost impossible to tell which ones are ""allowed"".Did anyone else feel the same way? I'd really like to know what Jony and Kevin were smoking when they approved this, and the solution (just scroll through binary colour options) is so painfully obvious. I really hope Apple changes this because if you ever feel like you're fighting against the user interface, something is very, very wrong.",applewatch
As a college student with a June delivery window...,"I'm counting this as a test of patience as well as a study helper. While it's certainly distracting as all hell to be constantly checking this sub and my order status, I'm pretty sure it would be infinitely more distracting to actually have this thing on my wrist on the 24th, and since finals start roll around two weeks after, I would be totally screwed.

Old woman's opinion on Watch just seen,"Saw the watch yesterday... Micky taps the foot that his hand is pointing to. i.e. Left hand pointing left, left foot taps.I liked the feel of the 42"" sport that I bought. I liked the sport band better than the mesh one. I really like the accessibilty stuff, since I'm almost 70 and my legally blind DH is 91.The large time display is what I'll try for him. Changing colors may help, too. The tap was very light, so I'll hope the increased one is stronger.I am hoping that the watch will let me get out of the house more... take walks in our WiFi envelope, garden, etc. We can get calls on the iPhone and even if it's inside in my purse I can answer on the Watch. My MD DD is getting one so she won't be disturbed when she is with patients, but knows to check her messages between appts.  I'm looking forward to 'playing' with it's features, too",applewatch
Make us hope! Share your stories!,So before the Apple Watch it never seemed to be a problem to get any new product in the rural area of Germany I live in.Just one example: my girlfriend ordered the iPhone 6 from T-Mobile and got it on release day. I really liked it so a few days later I just walked in a shop and bought one without the need to search first!But with the Apple Watch this seems to have changed. I intentionally stayed at home longer on the 10. of April to be able to order the Watch in time. I orderes the black Sport as soon as the app was online. Still 4-6 weeks wait.And this wait is soul crushing!So please share your positive stories of Apple releases: there are some here on the subreddit where people tell beautiful tales of late estimated shipping dates but early joy! I want... no I NEED to here more of these stories!Make us hope friends!,applewatch

I can understand how apple might think it's more of a ""feminine"" band but a lot of other guys and people I have talked to who are getting Apple watches, really seem to like the modern buckle. I personally think the modern buckle looks super smexy and isn't just for females. It's not overwhelming but not to dull. It's got just the right amount of clean, simplistic design that just looks really nice and just feels really great too! What do you think? Should Apple make a 42mm modern buckle band?",applewatch

I wrote a Watch app to help you find your car. Free until Friday; LMK what you think.,"When Apple Watch was announced, I knew I'd buy one, but didn't know how useful I'd find it (AMAA about my closets full of technology purchases that went unused). So I figured I'd fund the purchase by writing an app.I came up with ""save this location and help me get back"" -- probably most useful for parking at stadiums or malls, but maybe also useful for camping or ""if we get separated, meet back here"" or ""I buried the treasure chest here, yaaargh.""The app is now live in the App Store and free. The price goes to $0.99 on Friday to (hopefully) recoup my Watch purchase (best case: Facebook buys the app for $2B; worst case, my Watch is a tax write-off).App Store: Locator PlusWatch screenshots: Locator PlusYou can download the app before you have a Watch; once you have the app future updates are free and it's easy to add it to your watch in a day or a year.If anyone's interested, I'm also happy to talk about learning to develop for iOS8 + Swift + Storyboards, the App Store approval process (hint: don't use negative space in Watch icons), etc.",applewatch

How good are the Sport bands?,"I've got a link bracelet coming (eventually) and I know I'll want to get a second band for things like hiking and running but I'm not in love with the color options Apple's currently offering.  Navy Blue sounds good, but who knows how long those Milan exclusive bands will take to trickle down to us mortals.  I was considering purchasing a third party band but I know that means I'll likely end up with something lower quality.My question, for those of you with experience, is how did you like the sport bands?  Is the feel significantly better than your average rubber watch band?  Is it worth getting an Apple one in a less ideal color?Thanks!",applewatch
Would distance from FedEx Distribution Centers affect the ship date?,"What I mean is, I'm relatively close to many FedEx Centers and therefore, they wouldn't need to ship my Watch out today in order for it to get to my door on Friday at the earliest.

Observation and Good News For All Second Batch Pre-Orders,"So we've all noticed that some people in the first batch have started getting confirmation of shipment... but some people in this first batch haven't gotten confirmationMeanwhile, according to Apple Insider, a few people in the second batch are ALSO getting confirmation while first batch people haven't received confirmation yet. (http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/04/20/apple-starts-charging-apple-watch-orders-preparing-units-for-shipping)This is rather odd, right? You would think a big company like Apple would respect the order at which customers placed their orders. Assuming Apple IS respecting this order we can only conclude one thing...Therefore: Since some first batch people and a few second batch people have gotten confirmation of shipment, while others in the first batch still have not, we can only conclude that Apple has allowed this to happen because the order DOESN'T MATTER. In other words, first and second batches should be expected to arrive on launch day or soon after",applewatch

(SS vs Aluminum) Does it bother anyone else...?,"As someone in the design field (architect), something has bothered me at the in store displays, the try on appointments, and on the may pictures that have been posted here, and I couldn't really figure out why until recently. The case materials have traditionally gotten more matte and brushed as time goes on and models iterate. The model line of iphones went from a shiny chrome accent (the 3?) to matte metal with the 5/5s/6.Is this old language stuck in anyone else's head? I ordered a SS just because I know it'a more dressy, but I can't help but feel that the sport with a non-sport band seems more modern. Does anyone else think the plain SS looks dated or very obviously first gen because of this? The matte aluminium looks more timeless to me.Conjuring up crappy fake chrome edges on like all samsung products. I guess I have to trust apple in their planned use of materials for future watches, but this one threw me for a loop. What are your thoughts?",applewatch

Apple Watch Companion App: Request.,"It's Chase Fromm (yes, me). Again. My buddy @AAgatiello (who develops in part for @iNoCydia_Devs) wanted me to give you all a heads up in asking him a little favor: here's his original post (which came originally from MacRumors.com):Hello all,I am making this thread because I really would appreciate your help with something - unlocking the Apple Watch companion app for anyone without a physical watch. I think it would be nice for people, including myself, to get familiar with it before they start using it with the watch. So, anyone who does own a watch, I would appreciate you doing this for me, and the community.1.) Download iBackupBot for your computer (trust me, it's safe, I use it all the time).2.) Plug in your iPhone, and make a backup of your iPhone that is paired with your watch to iTunes (locally).3.) Open iBackupBot, and on the left sidebar, navigate to System Files --> HomeDomain --> Library --> Preferences, and find the file ""com.apple.Bridge.plist"".4.) Right click on that file, and select export.5.) Post a link (or PM me if you're not comfortable) to the file. Or, just copy the contents of it (double click, and click cancel when the registration window appears, you don't actually have to register).Once I have that file, I will be able to add a key (BOOL) to other peoples', and therefore unlocking the app! The main problem here, is that I do not know what the bool is, but anyone who is paired with a watch, has it. Thank you!So if anyone can help him (and me) out then thanks a ton!-Anthony Agatiello and Chase Fromm.",applewatch

This only happens when I send a message from my phone, too. If I send one from the watch, it works perfectly fine. If anyone has the same problem or knows a fix, please let me know. Thanks!Edit: So I unchecked my AppleID in ""receive at"" one more to time to see if it would work, and it did! Maybe something happened the first time or I just thought something was wrong when there wasn't actually a problem, but just uncheck the AppleID under the ""receive at"" section in settings on your iPhone and it should work. Thanks for the replies and help everyone!",applewatch

Golfing with the Apple Watch vs the iPhone,"Played my first round with the Watch this morning. It was incredible. I used the Golf Pad app, it's free.  So much easier to double tap the crown and glance at your wrist for yardage and shot tracking. After a ~5 hour round the battery decreased less than 20 percent!Previously, I would use a Fun Golf GPS app for the iPhone. The app is compatible with Apple Watch but that feature is not free. I hated using my phone during play. It was annoying to swing with a big iPhone 6 pocket. Also, it was prone to scratching from tee and balls. Keeping in the golf cart was never ideal either. Not to mention, I was unable to use the phone with a glove on. After an 18 hole round my iPhone battery would often be down as much as 50%. Today, with the company of the Watch, my iPhones battery declined 25% max! To compare, colored versions of Garmin GPS watches cost upwards of $500, which is more than the SS edition. Now I'm just waiting for developers to make apps for swing analysis.",applewatch

Apple Watch First Day Experience + Unboxing,"So, after what seems like a long wait I now have my 38mm Apple Watch with Black Sport Band on my wrist and so far I am really happy with it.  A couple days ago I made a request to have UPS hold the package for me so I could pick it up Monday morning.  This ended up working out great and I was able to pick it up at 8:00AM.  However, I only had about an hour and a half to get it unboxed, set it up, and play with it.  With that said I still dont know everything that this thing is capable of.  Anyways, Ill get on with a review where I kind of split all of the notable features up and discuss my experience.  Keep in mind that, like I said, I havent even played with it for a full day yet, so there is much to be experienced and learned about this thing.Feel and Comfortability - 10/10So, this is a big one!  Something that is uncomfortable, no matter how useful, wont be worth any set of features in the long run.  This thing, however, is insanely comfortable!  I havent worn a watch since I was in middle school and it didnt take long to get used to it at all.  I was a little worried about the heart rate sensor causing discomfort against my wrist, but its quite the opposite.  When I first put it on I had the band a bit too tight, so when I started walking around and the blood went into my arms it felt like it was restricting blood flow, but I simply went down one adjustment and I no longer feel the restriction and it hasnt moved around hardly at all.Another thing many people have been worried about is the weight.  This isnt a weight that makes it feel like youre dragging your arm around by any means.  For me, it actually just adds to the premium feel and it really feels like a nice watch should.  If you really cant stand the weight, then you may want to go with the Sport, but I dont think youll feel much of a difference.Material Quality - 9/10This thing is really nice.  The display is fantastic!  The sport band doesnt feel like plastic or rubber as some have described it.  The stainless steel finish is really nice and I havent noticed any scratching yet.  There probably is some scratching, but its not really noticeable from a normal viewing distance, so Im not at all worried about it.  The digital crown scrolls so smoothly and fluidly.  Overall, its just really nice to have the premium materials and sapphire display as a bit of insurance against damage that may occur over time on a device that will see the elements on a day to day basis for at least a few years.  It all comes together very nicely and looks really fantastic.  The only reason I docked a point on this one was because its not made of gold, but really this is pretty much a 10/10.Notifications - 7/10Receiving notifications on your wrist is probably going to be the most often used feature on this Watch.  Its certainly the first thing that I noticed when I got it.  I was getting notifications from Alien Blue on my wrist and it was fantastic.  This holds true with pretty much any other app.  Being able to dismiss unimportant things without having to take my phone out of my pocket is great and disturbs people around me a lot less when Im in class.  With that said, I think there is much to be desired.  Actionable notifications are limited at the moment and you have to switch to the app for replies in messages.  Its pretty good as is, but could use some work.Glances - 6/10At the moment glances work pretty well.  Its a nice way to get some information quickly without needing to view the full app.  So, they are what they are, but I didnt rate them very highly due to it feeling a bit cluttered to me.  I think theyll just take some getting used to, but I think theres something left to be desired here.Watch Faces - 8/10These are great!  I am really starting to see that this rectangular screen is much more useful than a round one.  You can still have a classic circular watch face, but all kinds of little complications in the corners and its just a lot more useable space.  I have only messed around with two watch faces at the moment mainly due to the limited amount of time Ive had, but theres really a watch face for just about any occasion.  The only reason I didnt give it 10/10 is because I think that it should be opened up for developers to tap into.  Not even necessarily completely new watch faces, but basically allowing apps to display their own complications on the preexisting watch faces would be awesome.Sound and Haptics - 9/10This is definitely one of the coolest features to look forward to if you dont already have an Apple Watch.  The Taptic engine really does feel like a tap on the wrist and it works really well.  By itself, it makes absolutely no sound and its not at all annoying like a vibration can be.  Ive run into a couple of times where I either didnt feel the tap enough to raise my attention, but there were also times when I felt a tap that didnt really exist.  Most of the time it works really well, but a lot of it probably has to do with the band that you have.  I am thinking about getting the milanese loop and that was the most comfortable band that I was able to try on during my try on session.  I also think it would work better since it keeps the Watch a bit closer to your wrist than the sport band.The sounds right off the bat definitely werent too bad.  The sound it made really fit with the taps and it wasnt like a disturbing sound or anything.  However, I silenced this thing within the first hour I got it.  I dont want to be disturbing people around me all daythats what the Taptic engine is for!  I havent really tested any other audio capabilities, so thats to come I guess.Battery - 9/10In my limited first day of testing the Apple Watch has fared very well in terms of battery.  Ive been using it at almost every chance that I get and I only got it up to ~90% when I started my day at 10AM.  Its 6:45PM as of writing this and its at 35%, so its gotten a lot of use and has been off the charger for almost 9 hours.  Im finding that its losing an average of ~6% an hour.  If this had a full charge I would bet it could last me at least 16 hours with heavy usage.  On a normal day it could probably meet or exceed Apples standard of 18 hours.  When I plugged it in after the unboxing I found that it was charging at about 1% per minute, so it shouldnt take more than 2 hours to charge it up from 0%.  I would say that I only require a maximum of 15 hours of battery on a normal day though, so Im not at all concerned with the battery life and throwing it on the charger at night just doesnt faze me as that big of a deal.  So, from my standpoint, the battery life is great!Overall - 9/10In almost all the categories I have looked at so far, this thing has met or exceeded my expectations and over time it will probably only get better with updates.  There are some bugs and little kinks that need to be worked out, but nothing that would make it anywhere close to unusable for the time being.  I didnt rate workouts since I didnt have the chance to take a look at this today, but Ill probably go for a run in the morning.  Most everything seems to be working great and Im really excited to spend more time working with it and see what its capable of.As promised, here are some unboxing pics: http://imgur.com/a/bJk3WHere are just some pictures of me wearing the Apple Watch from different angles: http://imgur.com/a/TVsCp",applewatch

Any list of taptic patterns?,"I may have missed it in Apple's documentation, but is there any list of what sort of taptic patterns or alerts we should expect with specific apps?

I've been trying to keep track and determine patterns, but I'm not there yet. Does such a list exist?",applewatch

Delivery to office?,"So I probably won't be getting my watch anytime soon (June, still processing), but I placed the preorder to be delivered to my work which is in an office building. This is my first time ordering an Apple product for delivery and I've heard you have to sign in person or pre-sign.I'm just wondering if I had to sign for it personally or if anyone can sign for it. I'm kind of paranoid about the UPS guy not being able to deliver it and taking it back and after waiting so long I don't want that to happen.I wonder if i should just take the day off work and change delivery to my apartment or get it held for pickup. Or maybe I should e-sign?Any recommendations from other people who had it delivered to their office?",applewatch
Waiting game....,"I've been waiting, checking, and rechecking my order status like a mad man the last 48 hours in hopes I finally get out of the processing hell most of us still around here are stuck in.

I was half tempted to cancel mine and just get the 38mm, but when I tried them on the day after we ordered, I noticed the 38mm is too small on my wrist, yet I have petite wrists anyways. I love everything about the size of the 42 and it's just perfect. -sigh- I need to get off /r/applewatch and actually do something with my life in the meantime. Maybe then it'll come faster.",applewatch
38mm too small for anyone?,Has anyone gotten the 38mm and thought that it was too small? I'd like to order before I can get myself to an Apple Store.

Tip: Power cycle the Watch from time to time,"Yesterday after removing the Watch from the charger and putting it on my wrist at 8:30, I noticed at 11:00 that it had already drained to 82% despite not really using it at all. I turned off the Watch and turned it back on and it only dropped 8% in about 3 hours. Obviously there are some kinks to be worked out in Apple Watch OS and I am sure restarting it must help in some way. Just a friendly reminder that this could potentially help battery life so it's worth doing from time to time.",applewatch

Anyone else feel like this watch is totally magic?,"Like tapping it to wake it up, the screen that perfectly blends with the edges of the glass, the instant wake up when turning your wrist up, covering it to put it off, talking on the phone with it as though you were in a spy movie, controlling everything on your phone with it, quick data at any time you want.

Some known issues | Addressed with Apple | Logs sent to Engineering Team,"Hey guys, so I got my 38MM SG Watch and I am in love with the product. Definitely worth the long wait.However, there were some known issues I noticed and I will outline them below. Loud ""Click"" coming from the device when being tapped. This was ONLY when I was being tapped or when someone was exchanging their heartbeat with me. Apple said it was not a big issue, but they said to continue to monitor it.The NEW and probably the most significant issue was discovered today while inside the Virtual Setup appointment with an Apple Specialist. There were multiple occasions where I would be typing at my desk, or resting my hand on any flat surface and the display would actually turn on. A few significant cases: Where I was standing and I would hold out my arm flat, the watch would turn on. At my desk or simple movements touching a doorknob or shaking someones hand would turn on the display. Talked with a Senior Apple Care Specialist and they simply sent off diagnostic logs to the engineering team and they will get back to me within 48 hours. Overall, no performance issues, but just detection issues where it thinks I am looking at my watch when I am not.EDIT: Just thought I would share here incase anyone else had experienced this.",applewatch
It works find on the underside of the wrist,"I just got my Apple Watch today (CL, not from Apple*, sadly) and I'm happy as hell to report that the Watch works fine worn on the underside of the wrist.   Heart rate? Perfectly fine.   The heart rate glance had no problems.  I also used the activity app when I took the dogs for a walk and there were no issues at all.   There are a few oddities, though:  The motion to turn the watch face on is finicky and works best when I'm standing up, but not that good when I'm sitting down.   No biggie for me, though.One interesting thing:  It was getting dark while walking the dogs, and I just so happened to randomly glance at my wrist.  I saw a weird green glow coming from under the watch.  It took me a minute to realize they were the green LED's used to measure the heart rate.   They were on and visible the entire time, heh.*42mm SG.  I'm cancelling my ""processing"" order, so hopefully one of you lucky people will get yours sooner.",applewatch

Thanks guys!Edit: spoke to apple care senior guy, I couldn't really talk as much as I wanted to since I was on my way to work, but he said he's gonna call me back later.

One day in...42mm SG,"First full day with the watch. Went from 10a to 12 midnight with about 11% left. Heavy use, from checking messages, emails, and using it for directions. Not to mention letting my family use it and showing them how it works. Happy with battery life so far, but we'll see how it fares during the week.I didn't really notice third party app lag. It's there, but the amount of time is so minuscule that it didn't bother me at all.The activity feature is great. It was pretty warm today, and normally it would deter me from being active as I hate heat, however I did want to see how much work would be involved in completing those circles. As a motivational feature this is great. I hope I can keep doing this daily.Overall, I'm pleased. I looked at my phone less than I normally do, and I'm ALWAYS on my phone. I get a notification and with a quick glance I can determine if I want to deal with it now, later, or not at all. I'm still connected but it's so much less intrusive than it normally is to me.Using Apple Pay on it sparked a lot of questions today as well. Probably the neatest feature on the watch. Pretty damn convenient. Glad I got one. If you're still processing and the wait is killing you, be patient. It's definitely worth it.",applewatch

My 42mm SB has yet to ship.Proud to say that after a day of navigation to and from the park, walking, sweating, several notifications, splashes from water rides and about seven roller coaster rides, not only is the watch completely unscathed but at the end of the day (12 hours from time i paired my iphone till I arrived back home) I've still got 26% left!Love the Apple Watch but Apple Pay and Passbook would have been nice to have used.

My favorite feature of the Apple Watch...,DisconnectingEver since I've had the Watch I've spent less time on my phone. I was at the beach with my family on Saturday and I didn't once take out my phone for the whole 4-5 hours we were there. Sure I had notifications on my wrist but I wasn't inclined to dig into them and wander in my phone. I went to a street fair yesterday and only took out my phone to take pictures. To me this is the number one reason I bought the watch and also the hardest to explain. I think the entire product is hard to explain.

1 week review,"There are many reviews of the Apple Watch on here so I'll keep it brief to what I have found helpful. I've been using a Pebble for over a year now. I would use it to tell the time, to change music while driving or at home, and to view and dismiss notifications. What is great about the Apple Watch for me is that it's a very active device. With the Pebble, I would see the notification first on my wrist and then have to pull out my phone if I wanted to respond. With the Apple Watch, I can easily send a response quickly using Siri, or even archive a quick email, for example. This alone has made this thing great in my every day life. The Activity app I thought would be a gimmick but it actually motivates me to get out more. I'm a runner and it has pushed me to run further, more so than any app or any device that I have used before. I stand a lot at my job, and every once in a while it would remind me to stand when in fact in that moment I was standing. Over time this would get less frequent once it learned my behaviors but it was annoying the first several days this happened. I have never had issues with raise to wake. When I am laying down and I raise the watch to see the time, sometimes it doesn't turn on for the angle I am in and I have learned to just tap the screen against my nose to wake it really quick if my other hand isn't accessible to see the time or notifications.I had issues with the taptic engine the first several days. With my Pebble, I had the ""Vibrate on Ring"" and ""Vibrate on Silent"" disabled on my iPhone under the Sounds setting since my pebble would vibrate instead. No need for my iPhone to vibrate as well. This actually disabled the Apple Watch from vibrating as well. Once I figure this out I never had issues with the taptic engine. What is nice about the taptic engine is how soft it is. It's not overpowered. With the pebble it was loud and full throttle always. If I am active, that generally means I am busy and therefore wouldn't want to respond to notifications anyways. With the Apple Watch, I wouldn't feel a vibration during these times like I would with my Pebble. Therefore, the Apple Watch distracted me less than my Pebble during these moments. At first it bothered me that I didn't feel everything always, but I grew to like it. Since after these moments I'd check the time anyways and at that moment I would see that I had notifications and I could go from there. Battery life hasn't been an issues for me yet. I'm up between 16 and 18 hours every day and by the end of the day it's in the 20-30% battery left range. Perfect.Other than that it's been great. It is the best smart watch I have used thus far. It isn't for everyone. But if you are the type that enjoys smartwatches, you won't be disappointed with the Apple Watch.",applewatch

The watch face is stuck at night even when you scroll with the Digital Crown but I think I've found a fix. By turning off Locations Services for Apple Watch Faces under Privacy on your iPhone it should make it work like it's supposed to.

Using a 42mm Leather Loop on 38mm Watch,"So, today I realized that the 42mm Leather Loop fits on the 38mm watch, with only slight protrusions in the four corners.I really like the design and functionality of the LL, and would like to use it on my 38, but I have no leatherworking skills.  Has anybody cut down/modified their leather loop to better fit on the 38?  If so, what techniques did you use?  Any idea how Apple polished the edges of the leather loop?Update: Results from filing the corners.  The finish on the sides is a bit off, and I need to file a few pieces of debris and a bit more, but I'll grab some black shoe polish tonight after the gym.  Right now, I don't think that anybody will notice unless they are a few inches from my arm.  Over time, as both the Watch and the LL get scuffed up, it's probably going to blend in even more.No metal was encountered during filing, the corners appear to be entirely leather.Update 2: When I polished this tonight, I noticed that the corners aren't entirely leather - they were leather wrapped around some kind of black plastic.  So, it's not possible to get a perfect polished finish due to different materials being used.  But in almost all lighting conditions, nobody is really going to notice.  If anybody else does this, I recommend not cutting with a razor blade (that's what I did on the shorter piece).  Instead, sand down very slowly and with great care.Update 3: The leather around the black plastic is fraying a bit, so I'm ordering the black Edge Kote mentioned in one of the comments and plan to apply it to seal the corners.Update 4: The Edge Kote did the trick!  It dried a bit shinier than I expected, but it looks better than the raw black plastic piece.",applewatch

Scratching on display,"Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening r/Applewatch! I've had my SG BSB for 4 days now and the scratched that appeared within two hours of owning the watch is driving me insane. The only metal object that I can think of that came into contact with the display within that two hours was the Metal pin on the sport band. That wouldn't have caused the scratching would it? I thought this ION-X glass was ~8 on the hardness scale. I thought it could've been the oleophobic coating that might've scratched off after coming into contact with the metal pin and was wondering if I could possibly fill the scratch with an oleophobic kit meant for iPhones? I'll try and post a picture of the scratch in the best light possible.Thanks in advance,",applewatch

But what do I know, maybe they just suck at designing and making softwares...All the other watches seem really nice (not shabbier than Apple Watch IMH, and I bought a SG 42mm) but I absolutely hate Android Wear design with a passion...why can't they just make something modern, Android OS in general makes me feel like living in Lego Land...",applewatch

Only r/AppleWatch will understand my struggle.,"As a long time Apple user, I decided early on I wanted an Apple Watch. I had bought a first gen iPad and waited in line for the iPad 2. Not long, mind you, but still. Anyway, I live in California so the Watch went on sale at midnight here. I didn't want to stay up late because I get up early for work.So, I thought, I will just order it in the morning. No big deal. I'm sure ordering 5 hours after the launch will be plenty early. Little did I know. However, my wife, as she does from time to time, awoke in the middle of the night. So, it being 2 a.m., she decided to order her Watch. She assumed I stayed up to order mine at midnight. That's why she didn't wake me up to order mine.Her Watch arrived today. Mine? Processing. Earliest delivery is May 29, latest is June 11. It's only a couple weeks. But, I am not going to lie. I'm bummed.On the other hand, I should be able to get her to return text messages more quickly now. :)Thanks for letting me share.",applewatch

Apple Watch at the Airport,"For security of course I used passbook on my iPhone because the scanners require you to lay the device face down which would be awkward with your wrist. For boarding  the flight though it was amazing. Everyone is lining up, fumbling in their pockets for their ticket. I already had the passbook app open because I was looking at my position in line. When it came to be my turn I simply double tapped the crown to move from watch face to my previous app (passbook). Told the security guy ""let's see how this works..."" -  held my wrist underneath the downward-facing scanner and vuala - worked like a charm. The security man said that this was the second ""one of those things"" he's seen today. Some teens behind me got a little closer than usual after they had their tickets scanned - surely trying to get a better look as to what was on my wrist. It was SO EASY.

Thought you were crazy. I'm a fan of dark things. I thought the Space Grey was the nicest thing ever. But then I saw pictures. The sport with the black band is incredibly good looking. I preordered my SG on 4/17. I'm watching people who ordered theirs 15 minutes after midnight on the 10th still waiting while people who ordered the white band option on the 24th are receiving theirs. Decided to try and order the white sport band with an extra black band. If the SG comes first, I'll be happy with it.

However, I'm 2 hours away from Harrisburg so it's still coming tomorrow!(Exchange requests are way faster than a regular band order, I believe all of them except LB are shipping fast, almost immediately)And the 38mm SS Milanese I ordered a week before I ordered the BSB is still processing!! I knew going for the BSB and then exchanging the band would be faster.So if anyone wants a 38mm SS Milanese without waiting..... that's how!Edit: Forgot to mention if you paid with Paypal or a gift card, this doesn't work. They won't let you return/replace the band. And you can't get an Apple Watch tier band if you bought a Sport watch originally.Edit 2: So this was downvoted along with every single one of my comments here. WHY?! Please explain this to me /u/afischer15, /u/E0_03, /u/GamerTyke, /u/InsaneCrazy777.This is probably the most useful threads to people without a watch who want to get one FAST.",applewatch

Some insightful intel about the production on the 42 SGS watches.,"I think you might find this interesting. I was one of the lucky guys to be charged and shipped today, and my order time was XX:12:02. I managed to get the Serial off my upcoming watch and ran it against the chipmunk database. And these were my findings. As you can see, and what I found the most interesting is the fact that the watch was manufactured in May, which lead me to confirm that indeed the 42mm SGS watch was underproduced and the first batch of watches didn't even cover up to the first 12 minutes of pre-ordering. I'm not a CSI genius like some of you, but here's the intel so you can make out things. I don't even know when week 19 was, but it has to be in the last 15 days definitely.Here's the screenshot",applewatch

Watch apps remind me of Web Apps when iPhone launched,"If you guys will recall, before iPhone OS 2.0, Apple elected for developers to create web apps that would run inside Safari (Here's a link.)  Clearly, the iPhone was capable of running more sophisticated native software, but Apple restricted its SDK instead.  It's certainly similar to the Watch's development scene, which also doesn't allow native apps or access to the device's internals despite it being quite capable.  However, this time perhaps it truly is a technological barrier to be resolved in Watch rev. 2 instead of a philosophical one with the iPhone.  In short, my point is that Apple has been conservative before; let's hope they loosen the reigns a bit at WWDC.",applewatch

I've ordered 10 watches - A tale of 5 weeks.,"(1) April 10th 12:01 AM PT - SS LB 42mm(2) April 10th 12:01 AM PT - AWS WSB 38mm(3) April 10th 12:01 AM PT - SS ML 42mm (4) April 10th 12:03 AM PT - AWS WSB 38mm(5) April 10th 12:04 AM PT - SS LB 42mm(6) April 28th - SS WSB 38mm(7) May 3rd - SS PMB 38mm(8) May 12th - SS PMB 38mm(9) May 13th - SS WSB 38mm(10) May 14th - SS WSB 38mmSo I woke up on April 10th and really wanted (1) and (2) for my wife and I.  At the times above, I ordered (1) and then (2), but realized that (1) wouldn't deliver until Mid-May, so I ordered (3) so I could have a watch on April 24th and see if I really liked the watch.  I realized, though, that I ordered (2) with ApplePay and my billing address was wrong so I also ordered (4) with the right address, and I also realized that I ordered (1) without a gift card I was meaning to use so I ordered (5).My wife and I receive (2), (3), and (4) on April 24th and we love them.  I end up putting (4) on eBay and sold it for $510 (purchased at $376 after taxes.. $100 profit).  My wife, liking the AWS, wishes she could have a SS case since she likes the different bands.  So, we return (2) and order (6).  A few days later, she really wants a sleep number bed so she asks me to cancel (6) so I do.  As a surprise since she was willing to sacrifice her watch for a bed for her bad back, I order (7).  Apple immediately cancels (7), citing that I've ordered too many watches per house hold.  The return period for (3) was going to expire on May 8th, so instead of just returning it, I list it on eBay (as used) and sell the $750 watch for $1100 ($250 profit).I try again on May 12th with (8) and the order sticks.At this time, (1) and (5) have arrived, and I list (1) on eBay since (5) was used with the gift card and thats the one I want to keep.  This watch sells within a day or two ($1060 watch, sold for $1400, $200 profit).Realizing that my wife was fine with the WSB but just wanted the SS case, I cancel (8) and purchase (9) only to have Apple's automated system's instantly cancel my order.  I wait another day and have purchased (10), this order does not get canceled and is looking to deliver on June 3rd.tl;dr: I ordered 10 watches, a few were canceled, and a few were sold on eBay.  I ended up getting a SS LB watch for myself through eBay profits and a gift card for about $50.",applewatch
Average difference between estimated and actual shipping dates,"I don't think I've seen anything exactly like this around yet, so I figured I'd start it.Now that watches have been shipping for a while, I was wanting to try to collect examples of what people's estimated shipping dates were compared to when their watch arrived, so we can get a feel for how well Apple is beating expectations (and see if there are any patterns).For example (made up):Estimate: May 13-27Shipped, delivered on May 10(thus beating the estimate by 3 days)I'm mainly curious in general what the average is, but also slightly because my estimate is May 29-June 11, and I go out of town for a week on May 26th. I'm wondering if there's a chance I'll get it before I leave, or during/after.The model probably has some to do with it too.

"No screenshots when battery is low? (or: ""[un]pleasant surprise in the battery life department"")","Last night I put my watch on the charger just before bed, as usual. What I failed to realize was that I didn't plug my charger back in to a power source after an overnight trip. I realized this when I scrolled past my battery glance around 11am today and it showed 28% battery remaining.So I thought I'd take the opportunity as a test of the battery. I did take it a little easier on the watch, knowing I wanted it to last, but I decided I was going to avoid power reserve mode and just see how long it would last. I just put it on the charger (plugged in this time!) at 1% charge at 8:30 pm. That's about 36 hours off Friday night's charge.Anyway, in going to take a screen shot for this past, I noticed it would not take a screenshot and instead gave me haptic feedback (three quick touches, if I remember right) when I would attempt a screenshot. I hadn't heard anything about screenshots not working when the battery was low, so I thought I'd throw it out here to see if anyone else has seen this behavior.Yes, I did restart the watch and attempt it again.TL;DR:  Watch wouldn't take screenshots below ~10% battery even after reboot. Has anyone else noticed this, or would anyone be game to test it next time your watch battery gets low?Edit: Well, it seems I may have jumped the gun a little bit. After sitting on the charger, at some point the screenshots showed up on my phone. Presumably another battery-saving feature by not transferring pictures with low battery. Interesting, for sure.",applewatch

Not All Taps Are Alike...,"I've been wearing my Apple Watch (38 SS ML, if you're interested) for a little over a week, and I have come to notice that not all taps are alike. When I get nudged to stand up, for example, it feels like a subtle ""two-tap,"" yet when the phone rings or a timer goes off, it feels like a longer staccato tapping. And receiving a message or an email seems to fall somewhere in between there. Is it just me, or are there variations? If the latter, it sure would be nice to be able to customize those variations.EDIT: It would also be nice if Apple (or someone) supplied some sort of cheat sheet to help us learn what each kind of tap means. I'm kind of getting used to it (e.g., I know what the ""get off your ass"" tap feels like), but I can't yet tell the difference between a message and an email without looking at my wrist.",applewatch

Why I Hate My Apple Watch And The Stores Don't Know What To Do,"Tonight, I just made my third Genius Bar appointment for tomorrow morning about me Watch. The first wasn't even an official appointment as I thought my band was falling out only to be told it was just loose and there was nothing to be done. I thought ""ok, whatever, some of my other watches have loose bands"". The second was on Saturday about how I was told I have a defective battery by both Apple Support and a few people on here. They told me that I should let the battery run dry and fully charge it twice. I did both cycles THIS MORNING and still was able to charge it to completion to have for a party this afternoon. Now, if I'm not told to do something else that won't work by someone who doesn't even have a Watch, I might just return it because three trips to a store to make sure my $700 watch works correctly is ludicrous! Not to mention they couldn't even run any diagnostics on my Watch after an hour of trying. Why should I have to wait another whole month to get this watch to work. The next person to ask me ""how much did you pay?"" or ""was it worth it?"", my answers will be ""too much"" and ""no"" respectively. Sure I could conceivably understand this kind of trouble on the base model, but not on the highest end one the normal person could buy. I might as well use the money I get back to build a decent PC. TL;DR $700 watch broken out of the box, Genius Bar doesn't know what's really wrong, two strikes against Apple Watch. Edit: the only time available for an appointment tomorrow is 4:15.

Haven't achieved my calorie target since 1.01.,"I had been meeting my calorie target of 770 calories daily. My usual exercise routine is an hour long walk with the dog in the morning and a half hour walk in the evening. Those two sessions plus whatever miscellaneous activity I do throughout the day is always enough to make my goal. I've notice since the 19th (the day I installed 1.01), I haven't reached my goal since. I think it is due to the heart rate sensor not performing as it had in the past. I do use the workout app for those walks, so I would assume it monitors more often than when it's not running the app. It seems like my workouts which are about the same every day are registering about 10% less calories than before.

I'm selling things to raise the money for a new watch, among these things I am selling my beloved go pro, which I won after wanting one for ages.

If you want to donate a dollar or 100 dollars or 5 cents it's appreciated. (PayPal will be listed at the bottom of this post)Now you are inclined to donate im just wondering if anyone would be kind enough to donate. Now your probably wondering why this matters so much to me and why should some random guy like me have the audacity to ask for donations? Well I'm about to explain: I love apple, everything they make is absolutely amazing and ever since I got my first iPod s friend gave to me I've loved the way everything works. When I heard the rumours that apple was making a watch I was excited, VERY excited. And I started saving before I even knew what the watch looked like. Now up here where I live most places won't hire people under the age of 16 ATLEAST and I've tried to get a job but I've had no luck, so in order to get the money I had to do lawn service all last summer and do chores and back breaking work to raise every tiny little amount of money, and around April 2nd I finally hit my target amount, after almost an entire year of waiting and and entire summer of the most tedious and exhausting labour. Well just like most of you I sat up on April 10th and put my watch order in. I practically had an orgasm when I put my order in. The two weeks after that felt like forever but eventually my watch came. It was such an amazing feeling and the watch was the coolest thing I think I've ever bought. A little less then a month later and ALL my hard work went right down the drain when I had my accident. Summary: waited for the watch, worked for the watch, loved the watch, broke the watch. So after all that if you want to donate my paypal is: airepicakaliam@hotmail.com If you donate PM me as I may reward the one who donates the most with a free watch related goodie (once i have money)",applewatch

Apple Watch SS Milanese Loop Shipping Times,"I ordered the 42mm SS BSB and I have a delivery window of 6/22-6/29. I also ordered an Brown Leather Loop that arrived last week before my actual watch, so I went to an Apple Store today and I tried on a LL and a Milanese Loop as well. I was pretty underwhelmed with the Leather Loop in person and on my wrist - it just didn't seem like a $150 leather watch strap. I liked the Milanese Loop way more. I want to return the Leather Loop and get a Milanese Loop instead. Just the Milanese band has a shipping estimate of 7-8 weeks which is about 2 weeks after my actual AW would arrive. However, if I cancelled my current order and ordered a 42mm SS ML Watch, then it should ship within 4-5 weeks, which is right about when my current order should deliver, so I'd probably get the Watch beginning of July, not end of June. I'm just curious about the shipping time on the 42mm SS ML.

MW/Band,"My Stepbrother works for MS. Thought I would check it out and couldn't miss a photo opportunity. I didn't extensively review or compare the two but I own an Apple Watch and wore a Microsoft band for a few minutes and I love the apple Watch more. I am a watch guy. I think the Band has some cool features like stand alone GPS and a tiny keyboard that is good at figuring out what your stubby sausage fingers meant to type but it's idea is more similar to a Fitbit instead of a mulifunctional watch. The Band will ""read"" (display) an email one line at a time (you set the speed) but in the quick demo I got I didn't see it as good as reading the email on the 42mm screen. The battery of the Band, I was told, is amazing - unless your using GPS. I thought the idea was good but it's execution wasn't as ""pretty"" and easy to use as the Apple Watch.

Question for those with the white and black Sports band.,"So I've had my black band for three weeks now and it's started to wear fairly noticeably already. Apple was kind of enough to swap it out for me since they felt it wore so quickly. Now my questions:Any of you out there with the black band that have had it for a while that haven't experienced any noticeable wear on it? As in, large portions of the band have started look as if a layer is peeling off. for those who've had the white band for a while, have you experienced any wear at all? I've only really heard of the wear happening on the black band.Thanks for the help, guys!",applewatch
"""Is that the Apple Watch?! What does it do???""","Every. body. asks me this question.  I've thought a lot about it, and now my answer is that it doesn't really DO anything.  If you approach AW like you would a smartphone, you will be very disappointed in its functionality; akin to how people could have been frustrated with the utility of an 1st gen iPad compared to a full PC. But you don't use it like you use your phone or laptop.  You forget you wear it.  It's a passive device, sitting quietly making small but meaningful improvements to your daily activities.  It's very organic; even something as geeky-looking as using Apple Pay just feels very natural, especially compared to iPhone.  It just makes sense. Yes, if they really want to know its features, you can explain notifications, fitness, apps, pay, etc.. However, for me, its best feature is that you forget it's even there; it's as a watch should be. How do you answer this question?",applewatch

Clicking noise when using the watch with classic buckle,"I have a stainless steel watch with classic buckle and black sport bands. I notice when I use the watch with classic buckle, often it'll make clicking noise. I switch to the sport band, haven't heard the clicking noise when receiving notifications.At first, I thought it's because I'm wearing it too tight / loose. So I tried wearing it really tight and loose with the SB, seems alright. Tried classic buckle really tight and a bit loose, when it's really  tight. It's just sometimes, however when it's normal to loose, it's often making the clicking noise, and the haptic feedback it's a bit weak.Anyone else have similar experience with classic buckle?Edit: Just realised that I'm not making myself really clear, the clicking noise I'm referring to is not when you put the strap back to the watch, rather than when you're using the watch, when the watch is vibrating/tapping you, it makes clicking noise.

Anyone want a gently used 38 SS BSB right now?,"(Note: the mods have okayed this post!)So as I posted recently, I lost my job a couple weeks ago and have been coveting the SGS every time I saw pics of it on here, so I finally decided to take the plunge and ""downgrade."" (I am loving the SGS, though! It's what I would have bought if I hadn't thought ""hey the SS looks more 'professional' and I can afford it now with this job!"" Duhr...)I contacted Apple and while they were very sympathetic, they confirmed that it's too late to do a return. So I will have to sell it, and I thought since there are so many people still waiting for their watches that I'd offer it here. The Watch is in perfect condition, no damage, and I just gently polished and cleaned it before putting it back in its plastic wrap and box (and whispering ""Good night, sweet prince."") The band has some very minor signs of wear on the inside only where the pieces contact each other and the matte finish has rubbed off. (Note I wore S/M, the M/L band half is brand new.) It comes in the original box and packaging with the (nicer than the Sport's! Grr!) charger and all documentation. Photos Honestly, aside from the slight wear on the band, you can not even tell that it is used.I am hoping to recover as much as I can, but obviously I want to give some discount since it is lightly used. I'm asking $550, or $600 including AppleCare. (I recommend the AppleCare because it will be way easier to get it now than trying to add it to a secondhand watch if you decide you want it. I confirmed with Apple I just give you the original Proof of Purchase and Certificate of Coverage and then email them with all your info changing the owner over.)PayPal only, since it protects both of us, and I have a 100% feedback rating on eBay buying and selling. :) And I will ship via whatever service you want right away because I know waiting SUCKS! So please PM me if you are interested or feel free to ask any questions. Thank you!",applewatch

Classic Buckle,"After hearing for a while that retail Apple Stores were starting to carry standalone watch bands, I decided to give my local store a call to see if they had a 38mm classic buckle band in stock. They did and I picked one up today.  For context, I already have white and pink sports bands and a Milanese Loop.  I have been waiting for standalone modern buckle bands to become available but decided in the meantime to check out the classic buckle again despite reading some negative comments and being a bit lukewarm at my try-on appointment back in April.  Now that it has been on my wrist for hours rather than just one among many bands for a few minutes during a try-on, I really like it.  In my opinion the leather is very attractive and comfortable.  I like that the leather is a flat black with no stitching.  I like the leather grain.  And the buckle is more attractive (and functions better) than any buckle I have ever owned.  At the moment I prefer it to the Milanese Loop and will probably use it as my every day band.  Lesson learned - try-on appointment may be too short to truly assess the different bands.",applewatch

Wearing two Apple watches paired to two iPhones... AMA!,"Got my SBSS last week to replace my SGS, decided to wear both for a while. I even went as far as to get a T-Mobile 7 day free trial to have a second iPhone to pair the other watch with. If anyone has any questions about how two watches works, feel free to ask. Or if you want me to test out anything, let me know too!Proof... as if someone would actually lie about thisSome observations so far:I originally put my SGS in airplane mode when I got the SBSS to prevent the SGS from erasing itself after unpairing. I thought that the moment I turned off airplane mode the iPhone would go ahead and delete the SGS, but it turns out it didn't do much of anything.Right now I have my iMessage signed onto both phones, and somewhat predictably, there is a slight delay in one phone/watch combination getting a message/tap/sketch over another. It seems random, probably based on network and so forth.I'm right handed, so it seems to make sense the activity app on my right watch seems to pick up more steps, calories burned and exercise minutes than my left one. Also on occasion, one watch or the other would miss that i stood for an hour.Battery life savings on airplane mode seemed minimal at first, my SGS left in airplane mode drained just a tad slower, which leads me to believe the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth radios are pretty power efficient. Now that I have both paired with iPhones I can see how a month old battery compares to a week old battery.",applewatch

Got it around 11am, had it on, messing with the options, and demoing it for friends and customer (work for T-Mobile) that wanted to see it. Tons of notifications and using Siri every opportunity I get, lasted me 12 hours. Just got home and put it on the charge at 5%. Normally I don't even go out so I would have been home sooner and put it on the charger around 20-30%. Love this thing.",applewatch

Great Watch App: WaterMinder,As I am trying to live healthier I have noticed I do not hydrate well throughout the day. I looked through a bunch of apps to track water intake and this looked like the best app/deal. One time fee of 1.99 instead of a bunch of vague in-app purchases like many other.

Why I'm selling my Apple Watch (SS BSB),"Ive had the watch for two weeks now, and I think the thing that most impressed me is how much it made me appreciate my Citizen Eco-Drive.[DISCLAIMER] I did not pay for my Stainless Steel Black Sports Band Apple Watch. My work bought it for me as a thank you for some recent projects performed above and beyond. The important thing here is that I had not planned on purchasing the watch, and was instead going to watch the direction Apple took with it.[/DISCLAIMER]Pairing with my phone was simple and it does all the wonderful things you can read about and watch videos of. I wont go into detail about what it does. Instead, I thought Id explain why Im going to sell it.OMFG Alerts! I have a female friend that likes to text or message me. When she gets going, itll be rapid fire multiple messages. At that point, Im beginning to wonder if my watch has turned into a new sex toy. Sure, I like to stay on top of things and Im a generally connected person as someone who works in IT. In fact, I pride myself on my rapid response to communications, so it seemed the watch would help me catch those missed alerts and mails when the phone is too quiet, or I cant feel the vibration through my coat.Instead, what I found was Id be having a nice conversation with someone, and suddenly my wrist would be begging for my attention. This was something I grew to loathe. Yes, I can place it in silent mode or whatever, but its one more thing to remember and one more distraction from actually connecting with people in real life.But the apps! Im a runner, and I have a Suunto Ambit 2 that is quite frankly the most badass running, swimming, triathlon, mountaineering, and hiking watch Ive ever laid my eyes on. The screen is always on and I dont have to do a magic flick of my wrist to see immediate information about pace, distance, and heart rate. All of that is on one huge screen I might add. Which means the Apple Watch is sorely lacking compared to my usual training watch.What about the other apps? What about em, I say. Theyve 1/10th the functionality of the phone version which usually means I have to grab my phone anyway, so the watch really delays the inevitable for me.Im not here to hate on the Apple Watch, I think its a fine device and will certainly work for people other than me. Working in IT for the past 15 years, and growing up with computers, Id have to say Im a bit burned out on gadgets. Electronic gadgets promise so much, and every year on the new refresh cycle were left wanting more and lusting after the later version. This is a rant for another day, however.Does this soft core rant make me a hipster? Gawd, I hope not. I dont roll my pant legs up and I still wonder what the fuck is up with those ankle height boots; but I digress.Suffice it to say, I wasnt sure the Apple Watch was for me, and Im lucky to have had the opportunity to really find out first hand.Wheres the best place to sell this thing anyway? I fucking hate eBay and Paypal, thought the alternatives seem to have higher risk.Commence down voting :)FYI - Ive been a OS X user since 2002 when Apple switched to Intel Procs and released OS X, a POSIX UNIX - which was a BFD at the time. My attitude is pretty agnostic as far as systems and oss go, not fanboy and not a hater of any of them.",applewatch

DAE experience random reboots?,"So after a few weeks now, I've run into this problem.Randomly, I'll be going about my business and feel my Apple watch vibrate, and when I raise my wrist to check what notification I got instead I see the Apple logo, and that my 42 mm SGS has rebooted itself for no reason. The first time it happened it resolved itself quickly and I ignored it. A few days later it happened again, resolved itself, and then occurred again every 15 minutes or so. At that point I unpaired my watch from my iPhone 6 and re-paired it. This seemed to fix it.Now, a week later it randomly rebooted again while I was in line at the movie theater. This time though, it got stuck in a loop of rebooting. I tried hard resetting it by holding both buttons but it was unresponsive. Finally I just tried holding down the button (not the crown) and after a few seconds the display jumped from the Apple logo to the watch face. It seemed to be catching up? So far it's been stable.Has anyone else had this happen? What causes it? Do I just have a defective Apple watch?",applewatch
How do you clean your Apple Watch (after a workout)?,"I haven't yet found the perfect way to get my Apple Watch (Milanese Loop) perfectly clean after a workout session.

How do you clean your watch in general, and how do you do it after an exercise?",applewatch
Are you guys sure they actually tested this thing?,"Sorry to be a downer, but I'm a developer and just got my watch earlier this week. I wear real watches and my pet peeve is definitely that I can't just glance at my watch to see what time it is, but I still expected a LOT more polish from Apple. For the record, it's paired with a 6 plus. It's almost as if the QA guys didn't actually USE one!go into watch settings and adjust calendar settings. Notice the calendar settings don't update with your changes until you back out and reenter?  I wonder if they would accept an app I submitted with such obvious bugs?my wrist generates a haptic response at least ten times a day to catch my attention. So I lift the watch, wait for it to notice, and... It shows me the time!!  Uhhh. Why TF did you beep AND buzz??  It's friggin 9:26!!  calendar glances. I have six appointments tomorrow. If I pull up calendar glances, it tells me I need to take out the trash on Monday. Really?  What about taking the kid to gymnastics?  What about Hailey's birthday party?  Dinner with my parents on Saturday??  No... Skip those calendar events... Just be sure to take out the trash!!  Hailey probably has lice anyway. Lots of the third party apps just don't work. Wanderlist is a blank screen. Wunderground works, but before the app starts, the screen turns off.  I thought there was an approval process?4.1) this problem is not limited to third party apps. Open weather and the screen turns off before it loads. Wake it back up and you go to the home screen. Start weather again and it loads, but turns off within less than a second of actually showing the weather. Flick my wrist again and weather is spinning again, like it's loading for the first time and ... Screen turns off!!  Thanks!!!  I guess I'll just look out the window...I have apple pay set up. But if I open passbook, it says I have nothing set up. I get notifications of payments no problem, but passbook says nothing is set up. I use my phone to pay (though I have a separate rant about that crap..)stopwatch. I use a stopwatch while cooking to see how long things are on the pan/grill/etc. this should be AWESOME right?  Wtf?  Did anyone try using this?  Analog lets you time and lap, but only if you swipe up no cumulative time. Digital, again, no cumulative time. Graph, doesn't display ANY lap times, just draws them on a graph. Hybrid had the most hope but the least actual functionality. No lap times at all and definitely no cumulative times.  Thank goodness my oven has a timer function!is the day of week such a secret, of does apple have trouble figuring it out?  I dunno, call me crazy, but my schedule is heavily driven by the day of week because I have a child. Because I have a child, I am also completely lobotomized most of the time. Is it SOOO hard to just tell me the day of the friggin week so I know if today is gymnastics or dance without trying to remember what TF I did yesterday?!?!?  None of the regular analog watch faces offer this information. They can out my initials in the middle of the watch - I have yet to come up with a use for that - but the day of week?  NOOOOO!messages. Ok, so, my friend sent me some inappropriate messages (him looking at porn on his apple watch.) I delete that stuff from my phone, cause... It's inappropriate. So someone else texts me and my daughter starts checking out my watch and Lo-and-behold!!!  Those messages are STILL ON MY WATCH!!  What's more, I can't delete a particular inappropriate message!!  I can only delete the entire conversation!!DND. This thing has a haptic thing, right. Well, my phone goes DND after 7pm so I do t get weird texts that wake up my kids and annoy the wife. But I could at least get a buzz notification of a text on my watch. Nope. Can't do that. It's either full beep, buzz, display or nothing. I'm guessing apple decision makers probably don't have families. photos. Okay folks, this is where I am SURE nobody at apple actually tried using it. When you open photos, what would you typically want to see, the most recent pictures, or the one halfway between now and the time you bought your phone??  If you said the latter, you are I luck!!  If you want to see the most recent pictures, you should look for another device. It's a three finger operation and you really have to be commuted to the cause!!  Even when you can get close, it'll take some perseverance to get to the most recent one!Okay.  I'm done. Overall, it's actually growing on me just for the notifications.  Though I still think it's too small. Oh, and the screen timeout!!  Dear God, what is it 2 seconds or something???  Couldn't make that configurable, could ya??  The worst is when I raise my wrist to see the time... The time does not show up.  I give up and wiggle the wrist. Still no time. What time is it??  As I lower my wrist, I see the screen turn on... So I raise it again and IT TURNS OFF!!!  WTF!!!  What time is it already?!?!?!  I'll just look at my phone....",applewatch

Finally Tamed the Exercise Ring!,"TL;DR After reading a bunch of posts, I put it in Other for my evening run.  Every minute of running counted. I'm not a fast runner.  My dog knocked me down last fall and hurt my hip, and it still hurts.  So I'm in the 16-19 minute mile range, counting stopping for dog pee breaks, dog swimming breaks, water breaks, etc.  I don't pause for that.  My HR varies from 100-150, depending on if I'm running leisurely or sprinting.  But I run a mile and a half every morning before work, and 3-5 miles after work, and on weekends I get in a medium run, and a long run of up to 13 miles.  So- it was annoying me that I wasn't getting credit for that.I use Map My Walk as my primary running app, I think because it has such a wide variety of types of runs/walks compared to MMR.  I like the maps (which I use for reference- I only do trail running) and the summary after the run.  I think I'm going to take a look at Strava, though.  Edit:  my true caloric burn will still be calculated by my heart rate- so I don't consider this ""cheating.""  The Move ring has always filled up easily for  me.  Edit 2:  Okay, I thought about this today.  So, just for the sake of argument, let's say I'm cheating myself by filling my Exercise ring too easily, using Other.  How does AW calculate my caloric burn?  It knows my height and weight, but then does it use HR?  I think yes, because doesn't it warn you that caloric burn calculation will not be as accurate if you disable it during exercise tracking?  But, even if it's steps, accelerometer, GPS (via the phone) or a combination, the end result is I'm burning more calories that AW told me to.  So how does it reward me?  It ups my calorie (Move) goal!",applewatch
Apple Watch Is Not Sending Real Heartbeat?,"If you place two fingers on the face if the apple watch when sending a message to someone else with a watch, you see a heartbeat that will be sent.  Apple says you are sending your heartbeat, but the heartbeat sensor does not light up during this time.  It would thus be impossible for the watch to be detecting your heartbeat.  It looks like the watch is either sending some preprogrammed heart beat or one that was saved from a previous measurement.  Does anyone know?",applewatch

Almost one month with my Apple Watch Sport. My review. And ~~some~~ a lot of background.,"So, I set my alarm on 4/10 at 0400 EST, to be first in line for the new watch. I was amped.Some background, I have worn a stainless steel Arctura Seiko Kinetic,with a stainless steel band since 1996. I also have a 1958 Omega SeaMaster ""With Sea Monster"" (my dads) and my Grandfather's 1953 Hamilton 18k gold ""retirement watch. I have always loved watches! Then I heard about the Apple Watch. I was intrigued. When the showed the models I was stunned. The Space Black Stainless with Link Bracelet was exactly what I wanted as it was stylishly close to the Arctura.Then they release pricing for that watch,,,ugh. I couldn't justify spending upwards of $1100 USD for a first generation apple watch. So I decided at that point the Sport with the Space Gray would be the way to go. Back to 4/10, If you haven't figured it out, I hosed the launch time offset for PST-EST. So I am an hour late for the ordering of what turns out to be the most popular version of the Apple Watch Sport.I get a ""June"" ship date. jeezus. I begin the daily hourly scrubbing of the /r/applewatch sub. I study order times, shipping windows,production yields, sales projections. In short the obsession was unstoppable. My poor GF had heard enough.After two weeks it goes to ""May 29- June 11th"". Then I hooked into the /r/applewatchshipping  sub. Then the movements starts to happen. I see second wave orders going out early. I see reports from supplies that the supply chain is ""up stop speed"". I start researching how many watches fit on the planes from China. For verification of the above, check my post history. It is certainly obsessive.I received my watch three days ahead of the stated shipping window.Build/Quality ImpressionsBuild quality is top notch. Typical Apple construction. Have had no quality issues with band or watch. Awesome work!I have a Spigen Crystal Screen protector on it. It is damn near invisible but provides me with a little comfort regarding the Ion-X glass. Getting it placed correctly is a beast though.The face is always bright and clear and always awakes when I look at it. I know some people have issues with this. I have not.I also have a Spigen Crystal case. I only use this at the gym. The knurled weight bars scare me around the black aluminum. The watch design is too slick to wear the case all the time. IMO. I do recommend this case as it is unobtrusive and provides some good protection against ""bumps and brushes"".The black fluoroelastomer band does ""stretch"" some. When I first started. I was a 4th hole from the end of the M/L end for a comfort fit and a 3rd hole for ""tight"" fit. That has changed to a 3rd hole for comfort and the 2nd hole for ""tight"". The finish on the band has remained unchanged with a little warm water and the microfiber cloth cleaning.Battery life has been acceptable. I get up around 0545 and asleep by 2315 and usually end the day with 20% battery remaining. I have fell asleep with it on (Damnit June 3rd) and woke up with 18% in the morning and by charging while I showered and dressed still made it through the next day. This includes about an hour of ""Activity/HR"" tracking daily. I do not have a charging stand. Do not see the need. It charges fine on the nightstand. YMMV.Applications/UI ImpressionsThe pairing process was painless and simple.If you are in a hurry to get started sync the Apple Watch compatible apps later instead of during set-up. that way you can tailor watch alerts that come to the watch easier and control what is loaded onto the watch.Spend some time tweaking your phone notifications. I have just gotten this down. I do not need the phone to vibrate for every alert when on silent. Let the haptic alert you on the watch. Took some tweaking but I think the key is to suppress the vibrate on the phone when the phone is set to silent. That way you just get the haptic on the watch and not the jump from your pocket.I have had no issues with alerts/notifications.Native Apple Apps are nice. The ""Activity"" app stands out! More on that later.Apple app ""Camera""  is great, the framing and timing are great. Calendar works, It is nice knowing what meeting is next.Maps and turn by turn is nice for walking, but the haptic seems to be ""weak"" for motorcycle and car driving.Phone. The call quality is acceptable for the size of the speaker. It is nice for when you are wandering around at home and the phone is not on you. Would not recommend for auto or public use.Siri is so much better on the watch. The dictation accuracy is much better.Apple Pay. Awesome. Nuff' said.Faces. Customization is nice. Cant wait for third party faces and complications. Standout faces are Chronograph and Simple. YMMV.Mail. Notifications are great. The haphazard way that some messages can be read on the watch and other push you to the phone can be frustrating. But I just use this to see the subject and sender. If I need to read the message and/or reply I need the phone.Text messaging - the contextual text message replies work great, A friend asked to meet at 6:30 or 7:00 and the first two options were""6:30"" or ""7:00"". perfect, and voice recognition for dictation is much better.The heartbeat and drawing app to send to another watch seems fun, I just don't have enough friemd with the apple watch to  make the most of it.Non-Native AppsNot a lot of greatness here, a couple apps stand out. IMO. This should improve drastically in watchOS 2.0.MacID - having my Mac and Mac Book lock and unlock based upon proximity is damn near genius.Wunderground - WeatherUndergound. After the interminable app loading time, having real time radar is nice. Did I mention the wait for it to load. It is not fast.MyPlate app. Works well with Activity tracking and calorie tracking to give you a running count of calories needed to consume.Standout AppActivity App is the best. The caloric tracking matches the gym on elliptical and treadmill.  Motivated me every day to get off my ass and move. The key for the activity ring is to walk at a pace greater than an 18 minute mile. That will fill it up every time.I have my goals set as follows,12 hours standing - which I think is unchangeable.30 minutes of exercise - which is my daily minimum.700 calories worth of the ""Move"" ring. I upped this to 700 calories after the intial week of 650 calories.The key here is to do a couple of running workouts and walking workouts outside with the phone to allow it to calibrate you stride length.My motivation to fill those circles is disturbing but satisfying,https://imgur.com/gallery/lGZNT/newStuff I haven't used or found usefulPictures - on a 42mm screen?? really?Battery Complication - use it as a glance, no need to be camping on it. The watch will last the day.Overall TL/DRA great watch and activity tracker. As native applications become available it will only get better. Highly recommend.Maybe the next version I will spring for the Space Black Link.edit - a word or letter here and there.",applewatch

My favorite Apple watch feature is band swapping,"I absolutely love being able to swap bands. Having a wide variety of smartwatches I had no idea how beneficial it would be.

"After one week with watchOS 2, here's my take","I'm a part-time coder, but not the kind that had a budget for a development watch and a production watch. So last week my only watch got watchOS 2 treatment, for better or worse.I'm mostly posting this to assuage the fears of those of you resisting the call of the beta. This is what you're missing out on.The goodI like the new photo and time-lapse watch faces - no complications but perfect for a weekend or winding down.The badI used to have 55%+ battery left at the end of every day. Now I regularly get 10% battery warning in the evening.The last time I sensed haptic feedback was a week ago. I'm not kidding. Even when force touching on watch faces to change them up I get nothing. Needless to say, I'm bummed about that.The last time I completed all three of my Activities rings was a week ago. I haven't changed my routine at all but I come up short, especially on Move ring. I suspect the tracker requires more fine tuning.The watch is very slow and glitchy, and often Notifications panel is just blank despite a red dot showing pending notifications.Anyway, I'm looking forward to watchOS 2 beta evolution but if you don't have it yet consider it a blessing.Edit: added formatting.Edit 2: found a fix for haptics (see below), it definitely wasn't a hardware issue.",applewatch

Is it anything like the rubber strap my Pebble has, or is it more pliable?And just to get a feel of Apple Watch-ness - how many Apple Watches do you see a day?

From A Day One User: What are the Practical Uses of the AppleWatch?,"So I stayed up late a few months ago and got my pre-order in early enough to get my AppleWatch on release day.  Yay!  I was kinda busy the first two weeks, so I didn't really have time to research all the amazing new applications for the device.  Now, having used it every day, I don't see any features that make it impressive, make it worth more $100 (It's a more reliable pebble, which was the absolute minimum I expected since it's an in-house apple product).I google AppleWatch features, and get crap apps (despite what bloggers think, I don't need 5 weather apps or Shazam!).  The third party apps do not seem to have developed yet.  When I heard about the AppleWatch initially, I envisioned a game changing device to plunge me into some high tech, cyberpunk world.  I just got a watch that receives notifications.  Period.  I use it for almost nothing else.Right now I tell everyone that, while I don't regret buying it (the wondering would have killed me), I recommend it to no one; it serves no purpose (not a purpose worth $500).  Am I AppleWatching wrong?  Did I miss some amazing feature release?  (I'm obviously an Apple fanboy, and I own the watch, so I don't need sales pitches.) What do people actually use their AppleWatches for?  What am I missing?  Or is it still too early?",applewatch
HOCO Stainless Steel 3rd Party Band - Quick Review,"Picked up a HOCO stainless steel link band (with a fold over Clasp) on Amazon.  PicsApple Watch:  42mm SS (ML and Black SB)Price: $33 - I'd say very reasonable at that price point.Quality:  Build quality is pretty good, the clasp mechanism is a little lacking.  You basically tug it open and push to close, no release button mechanism.Other:  It has a bit more brushed stainless look to it than the Amazon Photos.Overall, pleasantly surprised.  Decent quality at a low price.  Not sure if I will wear this more than the ML as a daily driver.",applewatch

"""Workaround"" for accurate calorie tracking","Since the current method the Apple Watch uses to track resting calories seems off (in my case, my watch says my ""resting"" burn is 2570 calories every day, but I calculate my actual base metabolic rate [BMR] at 1810), I've found an alternate method of tracking caloric burn (for the purposes of weight management) that, based on a few weeks of data, seems to be much more accurate than whatever the heck it is that the Activity app shows.It requires that you use the Apple Watch in conjunction with MyFitnessPal.Setup:In MyFitnessPal, use the ""Steps"" page on the More... screen to specify your Watch and Phone as your source of step dataCalculate your BMR (use a site like this one: http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/ )In MyFitnessPal, use the ""Goals"" page on the More... screen to set ""Calories"" (under Nutrition Goals) to your calculated BMR valueAlso on the ""Goals"" screen, make sure your current and goal weight are entered.In the Health app, go to Sources, select MyFitnessPal, and make sure that app is set up to read Weight, Steps, and Workout data.Method:Track your food intake in MyFitnessPal as you normally would. Let MyFitnessPal automatically read your steps and workout data from the Watch and Activity apps.MyFitnessPal will combine your activity level with your BMR value and give you a surprisingly accurate daily, goal-based target for your caloric intake (the calories ""Remaining"" value on the main screen)Using this method, MyFitnessPal gives me daily targets that precisely match my calculated Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) values. The ""daily burn"" listed in the Activity app remains way too high, meanwhile, and I am now ignoring it altogether. I just focus on meeting my daily move target, and let MyFitnessPal keep me on track with my diet.It works for me -- would love to hear if anyone else can replicate my success!EDIT -- TL;DR:The Activity app's ""resting calories"" value is too high, and you can't override the value Apple chooses for you. MyFitnessPal (and apps like it) let you pull the ""active calories"" data (which is accurate) from your Watch and add it to a ""resting""/BMR value that you can set. Ideally this value is based on the scientifically-sound, well-supported Harris-Benedict formula for BMR.The fix for Apple would be for them to correct their ""resting"" value OR let you override it with a value you calculate yourself.",applewatch

Battery life is no good...,"click bait - it's GREAT!My first full day with the watch was yesterday.  Slapped it on at 6:15am EST with 100% battery.  Used it a bunch throughout the day.  Being my first day, I showed numerous people at work the functionality of the watch, used it to check stats, weather, HR (every 10 min), activity monitor, etc.  I even took a few calls on it when my hands were full.  Finished my day at work, then went to tutor.  Once again showed a couple people some of the functionality and used it for notifications since I wasn't able to check my phone.  Went to dinner with some family members, showed it off and then went and hung out at a friends.  When I got home (around 10:30pm), it was storming, had no power and my phone was at 9% (Watch was at about 35%).  Obviously couldn't use my phone as an alarm, as it would die.  So I set the watch with an alarm.Watch alarm woke me up at 6:15am, with 15% battery still remaining.

Date Usage,"I live pretty frugally, so I can afford gadgets and things that I like, alas the watch.One thing I considered when buying it was now that I have access to something on my wrist, will I use a lot more data? I kind of accepted the fact that I would, as with my phone I typically use about 2GB a month, now I am adding this watch with it as well? yeah that will be another GB a month.Well nearly a week in, and my data usage has dropped considerably. What I didn't take into account was, for instance, a weather app, there is a lot of data that it is loading when opening, that I will never look at. With the watch, it is loading only what I need to see. I have found my phone use has dropped by half, and the last week I haven't used over 35MB a day (16MB if you don't count a day when I went down town and used navi, yelp, etc)Just thought I would share, it will probably not pay for itself anytime soon, but a neat little thing I have noticed... unless of course they bring ad's to watch apps.",applewatch

Extremely bad experience in pre-ordering X-Doria Defense Edge for Apple Watch,"I want to share with you guys on my experience in pre-ordering X-Doria Defence Edge for Apple Watch. Their customer service really pissed me off by cheating me from time to time and eventually THEY canceled my order and refunded to me at last minute, but having other customers order being fulfilled. I hope this disclosure of the details of email communication can act as an alert to you in ordering from them.I pre-ordered on 10 April for the Gold Color option but changed my mind to silver after 2 days. I got confirmation from the customer service representative Kim Brown that she would take care of my pre-order.On 27 April, I checked my order on their website and it said my order had been fulfilled but I did not receive any tracking numbers for the shipment. So I emailed Kim again to clarify.On 28 April, she replied me that due to a manufacturing delay, this product would not ship until late May or early June. I could change, cancel my order to accept a 20% refund of the cost if I could wait. I chose to enjoy the 20% off and I received the refund a couple of days later.At late May, I still havent received any news on it. Until 31 May, I received an email from Kim on an update on shipping schedule for Defence Edge and it was claimed that I would receive tracking # as my order ships. So heres the email:>In our last communication, we promised a shipping date for all orders in May. Orders for Defense Edge have finally left our factory but unfortunately, we are going to fall short of our promised ship dates once more.>To give some explanation, Defense Edge is made by a complicated process where we first mill a block of aluminum, anodize it and then inject soft plastic around the interior surface.  As we entered mass production, our initial results were not meeting our high standards.  Production has since stabilized and we are able to give more precise ship windows for your orders.>Apple Watch 42 mm >Silver - Silver units of Defense Edge have landed in Los Angeles and are in the process of transferring to our fulfillment warehouse for shipping.  Shipping Window - June 1 - 5>Gold - Shipping Window - June 22 - 26>Apple Watch 38 mm>Silver - Shipping Window - June 15 - 19>Gold - Shipping Window - - June 22 - 26>Again, we deeply apologise for the delays in fulfilling your order.  Please know that if you have changed your mind about purchasing Defence Edge, you can reply to this email and we will quickly refund your money.>We appreciate your interest and business.  We are working to get Defence Edge into your hands as soon as possible.So I acknowledged the email by replying and hoped they could ship as scheduled.On 19 June, I still havent received my tracking number so I emailed them again. And here is the email that pissed me off that they couldnt even give a valid reason on canceling my order at their side, while they said the shipped to some other customers indeed. This is completely a discrimination, unfair and unprofessional, as they should say to themselves instead!>A few weeks ago, we began shipping our Defense Edge in silver for the 48 mm Apple Watch.  While our production continues, yet again, we are unable to maintain our latest schedule to you.>At this point, it would be extremely unfair and unprofessional to hold your money or to make further schedule commitments as those commitments would not be credible.>So today, we are refunding your money. Defense Edge in multiple colors will continue to launch this summer but the timing is unknown.

Apple/Ive surprises me again!,"Read this in a forum, they should mention this in keynotes..""6000 Series Aluminum. Likely an alloy 6061-T6. Commonly known as ""Aircraft grade"" aluminum. Which I've always found funny, because the aerospace industry uses 5052-H32 alloy just as much. Anyway, 7000 series is a step up and fairly uncommon. 5052 alloys are the most common in my experience working in sheetmetal, and 6000 alloys are used sparingly for certain circumstances. 7000 series is used in only very specific circumstances. 5000 and 6000 alloys are seen as strong/light enough for most applications. You know the flight recorder ""black boxes?"" They're made from 5052-H32. And those things are designed to withstand a plane crash. So 7000 is used in only extreme cases of strength/weight optimizations. Btw, 7000 is very hard to machine due to being so much harder than 6000. So for those of you complaining that $350 is expensive, I'm frankly STUNNED that Apple is producing a mass market product intricately machined out of a 7000 alloy and only charging $350. That is simply unbelievable, a true display of their design and manufacturing excellence.""edit: comparison chartand [detailed info on types](http://www2.mae.ufl.edu/designlab/Online%20Resources_files/Omega%20Research%20Aluminum%20Metallurgy%20Info.pdf)",applewatch

The Future: Some thoughts about the Apple Watch and smart watches in general,"I'm a big tech guy and have watched and worn several smart watches over the last few years. My favorite (pre-AW) was the a Pebble and I have high hopes for the next Moto 360.What I think Apple nails is what I feel is the obvious future. Stick with me, this gets a little fuzzy.Let's look at the iPad and other tablets. There are entire consumer bases where a tablet is just the right amount of computer for them. It sends email, writes docs, browses the web, and displays pictures. With the ever-expanding App Store, it's becoming more and more reasonable to get an iPad over a traditional notebook.Like tablets, I think the Apple Watch will expose a whole new consumer base where a smart watch is just the right amount of communication device. And like the iPad, it's going to really blow up as developers are able to expand its feature set.Right off the bat, I immediately think of all the friends I have that barely ever leave the lock screen, quickly handling notifications as they come in (reply to text, archive email, favorite a tweet, play back voicemail, etc).So what's Apple's game here and why are they so damned smart?Apple entered this market because they have one thing that Pebble, Google, and Microsoft don't: brilliant third-party developers able to make a living from their platform, contributing to a healthy and fruitful community. Think of all the things that are now part of the OS thanks to third-party apps becoming so popular.Apple knows that their first outing just has to exist so developers can get to work on making the Apple Watch and early adapter consumers can help refine the use cases. We're not guinea pigs, though. We're just joining this adventure early :)I predict that the ""finish line"" for smart watches is a standalone device, with its own SIM card and data plan, with innovative low power antennas, and better ways to keep the thing powered.[UPDATE: Some clarification based on comments]A lot of people keep bringing up that they doubt a Watch could replace their computer. It's not about replacing your computer, it's about understanding that each device has a different skill set and that there's a category of user out there that the Watch (likely with WatchOS 3.0) will fulfill all of their needs with the added bonus of being able to do things quickly and right from their wrist. It's seeing the entire market potential, not just your set of use cases.",applewatch

Yet another Ripley's believe it or not; WaterProof.,"So I decided, knowing that it is under Applecare to really, really push my watch. To see what it can do. I have seen all the videos, and it seems to be common knowledge that the watch can hold up to water a little better then some would think. But my dealings with it have been drop down impressive. I have the steel with the white sport band. So, I am in Spain right now. I am Studying abroad. I have had my watch with me 24/7. It had been kinda neat seeing how much I've been walking. Getting directions on the watch, etc. Over the past month I have taken the thing into the ocean three times. One time we were kayaking around southern Portugal. Water splashing everywhere.  I did go swimming with it in the ocean. I did submerge it a fair amount. Secondly, I did take it into a bath house. This was before the 2nd beach trip. I did go into all three temperatures of baths, the salt bath, the jacuzzi and the steam room with the watch.With all of this though, the watch is fine. Everything works. It still looks pretty, it still makes sound, it still responds to my touch.The TLDR Is I know what Apple advertises, but it really does seem you don't have to baby this watch at all. It has been designed really, really well.Side note: I have had a lot of people ask me about my watch over here.  They really want it bad. haha",applewatch

Alternatives to Apple leather watch bands - Shell Cordovan.,"If you want to avoid the wall of text here are the pictures of my shell strapOver the past few weeks there have been several band replacements and modifications shown on this sub.  Some of them have been nice, and some of them have been questionable.For a lot of people a watch is a new addition to their lifestyle, and wardrobe.  This is new territory for a lot of people and they will make mistakes and learn as they go.Apple has provided a wide range of band types which cover most of the general band styles out there with the exception of a nato band, but that will never work as it would cover the rear sensors.  The design of these bands has been fantastic and suit the watch very well.  Apple has always had a great eye for aesthetics and the watch bands are no exception.  Unfortunately the area where they fall flat is the materials they use in the leather straps.  It is dry, and isnt going to look good for long (several years).  Provided the watch bands are interchangeable with future models, the leather strap you buy today will be lucky to make it a couple of years before it begins to crack, or worse smell.Luckily third party adapters for standard bands are easy to find, or alternatively you can use your classic buckle to add a new strap of your choosing.In my case i elected to go with an unlined shell cordovan strap from Fluco.  They use shell from the horween tannery in Chicago which with a handful of other tanneries world wide are the only producers of Shell cordovan.  The only issue i had with my band was that the stitching was a bit crooked , but it happens.In case you are curious Shell is sources from the rear of a horse and isnt skin like other leathers.  It is actually the fibrous flat muscle.  Shell is fantastic as it doesnt normally crease(it rolls) and it also doesnt absorb water/sweat like calf or steer does.  If you are put off by the fact that it is sourced from Mr Ed blame/thank Belgians, French, Quebecers, and even beef producers in Europe as they use horse as a staple meat.So why choose shell?  The tanning process packs it with oils and greases which ensure it will stay supple for decades, it looks amazing after it begins to patina, it wont crack(provided you take basic care of it), and it wont absorb sweat like calf does.TLDR - Apple leather is horrible, but their designs are great.  If you want a far superior band buy shell cordovan.",applewatch

For instance, if the high temp was reached at 2pm in the afternoon....And I check the complication at 4pm...Does it just omit that data since it is no longer relevant? Or is this a bug? It seems like you might still want to know what the high temp was for the day even though it's no longer currently relevant.",applewatch

Best watch apps for working out at the gym?,"I'm referring to physical activities like weight lifting, plyometrics, crossfit, yoga, or any other activity not listed in (excluding ""other"") the built-in workout app.The default app is quite awful as far as display options. There are 3 fields. Top field displays current time or elapsed time. Middle field ONLY displays elapsed time (why even allow top field to display the same elapsed time?). Bottom field displays HR, Calories, or elapsed time. Again... elapsed time can be displayed in three fields...There's seemingly no ability to change the fields from the above (or add fields). There are no laps or lap times (e.g., for rest intervals). You can't edit a workout. (e.g., sometimes I forget to turn off the workout timer and remember a few minutes later. I'd rather save the workout at 1:00 hour rather than the 1:05 including the 5 minutes of idle activity)Worst of all, there's no option to keep the display on the entire workout. (I don't care about the expense to the battery.) I often have to wait longer to get a new HR measurement than the display shut off time.Clearly, the default app was not created by someone who has ever stepped foot in a gym.I'm looking for something that shows HR, overall time, rest intervals, etc., and addresses some of those problems above.(Note, I'm not interested in running apps, unless they can do the above.)",applewatch

It looks like bull, and looks to be sponsored by case and screen protector makers, but if any Sport owners could confirm/deny this I'd rest much easier.Second of all, from everyone's experience, what's the water resistance looking like? I've seen videos on the internet, but would feel better actually hearing a more human feeling testimony.Third, do all notifications from your phone make it to the watch, regardless of if they are watch apps?Fourth, do all of my Siri configurations carry over? Such as family relationships, locations, nicknames?Fifth, what are some simple ways to keep the watch out of harm in day-to-day life, besides just being generally careful?And finally, how much iPhone battery does it consume on average? I have a ~2 year old 5s, and its battery is a bit on the rough side to begin with. Does the watch use a lot of it?Thanks for all the help everyone.

For example, while sitting at my computer doing work during the day, the watch reported 135 calories burned in 16 minutes with the workout app active. Without the app active the watch reported ~2/3 active calories and (averaged out) 27 resting calories.

Thoughts after a week and a half (SGS),"This thing is surprisingly durable. I've bumped it into things. I've had dogs jump up on me and their claws hit the watch. Nothing has put any mark on it. I've never been a watch wearer, but I've quickly grown accustomed to putting it on every morning; it's become a part of me now. The activity rings really are a motivator of sorts. I feel bad if I don't complete my rings and I try my damnedest to do something to at least hit the minimum goals.My only issue is that the digital crown now seems to be a little sticky when I turn it. Once it gets moving, it's fine, but I need to put a little effort into getting it going, whereas initially, it would be smooth at all times.On the whole, I think it was worth the purchase.

Most of the time I'm by myself and it's incredibly tiring and stressful, so a third of the reason I bought the apple watch is so I could track my heartbeat during said times. I bought my watch last night before work, and this is my health data from yesterday's closing shift: http://i.imgur.com/n9PNaoK.jpg The thing is that the busiest times are between 12:30AM-3AM, and my watch completely ignored those times.

Really on the fence about the Apple Watch and would love some input.,"Hey guys, today I tried on my friends watch and he let me play with it and I really started to like it.

Battery Life - What's Good for Batteries and What's Good for Warranties?,"Apple says the watch batteries are designed for 1,000 complete charge cycles while still retaining 80% of their original capacity to hold a charge. Presumably a ""complete charge cycle"" is charging it to 100% whether you start at 10% or 50%.According to this it's better for lithium-ion batteries to top them up than wait until they're almost discharged.Can Apple do a charge cycle count of batteries? If they can, do you think I'd void my AppleCare+ battery warranty if I top-up charge it maybe 10 times each week to try to keep the battery in good nick?  Or would Apple just replace my battery within 3 years no matter how often I charge it? Thanks for your views.",applewatch

I probably used my Apple watch for about a total of 25-40 minutes today checking the time, using a few apps and replying to texts through dictation and voice recordings.

[Update] SGS sport band repairs messed up... Emailed Tim,"So this stupid saga continues from here.  After about 12 days with my 2nd replacement black sport band with space grey pin, it started to wear smooth. It lost the velvety soft feel and looked and felt like shiny plastic rubber. More peeling and flaking especially near the lugs and the pin holes even though I only use one hole. I was already frustrated and disappointed by now since I was on my 3rd band.  So I called AppleCare again and talked with a senior advisor for about 40 minutes while he took down all the details and listened to my story. He had never heard of this issue at all so he wanted all the details from my previous bands and the interactions at the store I went to for the swaps. He saw the notes from the Geniuses and the dismissive tone as the previous two swaps were actually filed as CS codes (customer service exceptions, not valid warranty repairs). I expressed my displeasure and he recommended that he directly ship me a replacement black sport band with space grey pin to avoid an upsetting Genius Bar appointment and also to possibly get a part from a different stock.  I agreed reluctantly as this would be my 4th band...  One day later I get the UPS delivery alert and after a grueling day at work I arrive home to see the brown padded envelope from Apple waiting on my doorstep. After taking it inside and carefully unpacking it (since I need to peel off the label and return my band in the same envelope), I find the nondescript long white box labeled ""42mm"". I unzip the little white pull tab and slide the box out and what do I find?  A black classic leather buckle.  AppleCare sent me the wrong fucking band.  It's a gorgeous one though. Bright polished stainless steel lugs and buckle and nicely grained leather. I don't feel like it would match with my SGS at all though, and one of the main reasons I picked that model was for the stealthy all matte black look.  At this point I'm exhausted and beyond annoyed and pissed. I repack the leather buckle and without hesitation I compose a polite but direct email to Mr. Tim Cook. It's been a 2 month runaround with nobody taking responsibility for this issue and my satisfaction.  For anyone thinking that I'm nuts or a perfectionist or whatever for complaining about a $50 sport band, try to understand my perspective. It's not a one off incident, check the numerous other posts on this sub. It's only happening to the black sport band with space grey pin as far as I know. I feel like it's wearing out far too quickly for 2 weeks of office use. When it's wearing out it looks like a cheap knockoff band that I got for $5 on the street. It doesn't feel like it's something Apple worked hard at designing and making for a brand new product. It doesn't look or feel like Apple.  So we'll see if I get a reply from anyone today or this week even. I'm also waiting on a reply from the senior AppleCare advisor to OK me shipping the black classic buckle back immediately.",applewatch

It works pretty well, but the annoying thing is that if I don't check it once per minute, my watch will go back to showing the watch face.  I wish there was some way to temporarily lock the shopping list so it would show by default-  instead of the current time etc.    I had to constantly double click to switch back to the shopping list app and it just made for an inconvenient experience.  The greatest feature of the Apple Watch is how it makes things simpler, shaving seconds off a task you'd normally do with your phone.  I wish the shopping list experience was the same.",applewatch
FINALLY jumping in!,"After a long time of just wanting it, I finally made my reservation to finally go and get me my SGS! Well it's kinda one of those ""I feel like shit and need to buy something I want to cheer myself up"" purchases. Had my second interview with Apple yesterday and did not feel like it went well, unfortunately. I'll find out for sure if I got it or not sometime today. Since I'm not feeling good about it I decided I needed to cheer myself up and since I just got paid yesterday the Apple watch was the perfect choice! VERY excited to join the rest of you guys that are living in the FUTURE!",applewatch
Full charge is only 98%?,"I purchased my Watch Thursday night and I'm wondering if it's just me but after it's first nights on the charger it only had 99% when I removed it Friday morning. I thought nothing of it since I didn't notice it right away but when I did go to check it had only been 10-15 minutes. Then this morning I removed it from the charger and it immediately dropped to 98% and even checking the battery glance showed 100% for a brief second before reflecting the 98% again.Am I just being over paranoid, has this happened to anyone else or do I need to get a few more charging cycles in before judging this couple percentage loss right from a full charge?",applewatch

Sport Space Gray 3rd Party Bands,"Hey guys! I have a 42mm SGS Watch. I would like to change the band on my watch, the sports band is quite good in my opinion I would just like a change. Im looking for a cool 3rd party band, in either leather or textile (e.g. zulu or nato 2 piece band). I would also like to ask if anyone has any adapters to recommend. Thanks :)",applewatch
The difference an adapter makes!!!,Switched to a pin adapter from the other adapters we have all seen with third party bands and let me tell you WOW does it make a difference. http://imgur.com/ZyPOLtj,applewatch

Anyone want a 42mm SGS+WSB+ML?,"I could sell the watch and black band for 350. I could sell the watch and the WSB and BSB for 400. I could sell the watch, WSB, BSB, and ML for 550. I have the box, charger, case, etc. If there's another subreddit I could post on let me know.",applewatch
How to find friends with Apple Watches?,Is there any way to scan your contacts and discover everyone who has an Apple Watch? I like that by default my favorites from my phone ended up in my watch friends. But only one of those people has a watch that I can send doodles and stuff to. I'm hoping there's a quick and easy way to find this out.,applewatch
Apple Watch not registering hourly standing stats...sometimes,"Hello! I purchased my SGS Apple Watch two weeks ago and have been amazed since day one, it does all I wanted and more. Except, one thing. I'm making an effort to be healthier and get in better shape before my wedding and knew the Apple Watch would play a role in this process. Standing is a huge part of that, I know and I want to have 'complete' days as much as possible. I would say about 50% of the time, the watch does not register that I've been standing. I will get the alert to stand, click 'ok' and immediately stand up, walk around the house and do some cleaning or grab some water and will be up for 2-3 minutes but alas, it does not register. Is there something I am doing wrong here? Will it always give me the notification that ""I did it"" and can sit back down? I rarely get that, if so. Everything else registers perfectly, working out and steps but the stand just isn't getting filled despite the fact that I know I am meeting the goals! I googled it and searched the sub and some people stated they had similar issues but I didn't see any results. How does the watch know you're standing? I know it's farfetched but I have very long arms that lay below my waist, could the watch think I am still sitting because it is not as high up? Thanks for any help you can provide. Edit: Just in case anyone else has this issue and searches for it. I spent the day moving around when my alert went off, moving my arms around, doing some stretches, being silly and moving them up and down (as if I was doing curls with a weight) and wouldn't you know it registered each time! I met my goal with ease today and was very pleased!",applewatch
